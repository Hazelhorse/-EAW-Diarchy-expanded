  eqs_stg_settlement:0 "Encourage Equestrian Settlement"
  eqs_stg_settlement_desc:0 "Even before the first revolt, Severnya retained its own unique, special culture, seperate from wider Equestria. This was a mistake. Ponies from throughout the land will be invited to settle and live within the region, in order to show the locals how a true pony acts."

  eqs_stg_undermine:0 "Increase S.M.I.L.E. Operations"
  eqs_stg_undermine_desc:0 "Waging war to avenge ponies being killed would be madness. We cannot order more ponies towards death or disfigurement in some vain attempt to avenge past mistakes. Instead, we must undermine our enemy, and make him our friend."
  eqs_stg_friendship:0 "Pact of Friendship"
  eqs_stg_friendship_desc:0 "Through our generosity, kindness, laughter, loyalty, honesty, and the magic of complete infiltration of their civilian government, we have managed to convience Stalliongrad that we should enter into a pact of Friendship and non-aggression."
  eqs_STG_try_leaders:0 "The Canterlot Trials"
  eqs_STG_try_leaders_desc:0 "Having captured the leadership of the Red State, we must now bring them to trial. Hopefully showing them that their government is no more and that their leaders are captive will encourage the rebels to submit and realise their cause is lost."
  eqs_stg_remove_cores:0 "Remove their Spies"
  eqs_stg_remove_cores_desc:0 "Countless ponies with sympathies for the Red State live, work and operate within the border. In the event of war, this could be a fifth column that would rise up and hand these lands over to the Communists. We must strike first and remove this threat."
  eqs_stg_trade:0 "Provide Famine Relief"
  eqs_stg_trade_desc:0 "Stalliongrad has suffered from food insecurity ever since their separation from the rest of Equestria. If we provide foreign aid, free of charge, it will do much to improve their view of us. Nopony can stay angry on a full stomach."
  eqs_stg_embargo:0 "Throttle their Factories"
  eqs_stg_embargo_desc:0 "The Stalliongrad economy is still reeling from failed attempts at industrialisation and collectivisation. If we halt all trade flowing between Equestria and the Reds, we will hopefully be able to cause their economy to crumble under its own weight."
  eqs_stg_war:0 "Contain the Threat"

  eqs_STG_conquered:0 "The Failed Revolution"
  eqs_STG_conquered_desc:0 "The mistakes of 995 have finally been corrected. With the violent successionists dealt with, the Severyanian will no doubt welcome the change to reunite with the rest of Equestria."
  eqs_STG_fix_food:0 "Famine Relief"
  eqs_STG_fix_food_desc:0 "While famine in 995 drove the Severyanian into the hooves of the Reds, the situation does not seem to have improved much in the past decade. Whatever system the Reds hoped to fix it with has been ruined by the war, we must start importing food into the region."
  eqs_STG_land:0 "The Issue of Land Ownership"
  eqs_STG_land_desc:0 "Due to their strange beliefs about land ownership, the majority of farm land in Severyana was held in the hooves of the Red State. With its defeat, legal control and ownership of those lands has now passed to the Equestrian Crown. What are we to do with it?"
  eqs_STG_land_privatise:0 "Privitisation of Farmland"
  eqs_STG_land_privatise_desc:0 "The only way to restore this land to productivity and growth is to sell it to the brave entrepreneurs and industrialists whose tireless work has ensured Equestria's place as an industrialised super power."
  eqs_STG_land_farmers:0 "The Legal Rights of Landlords"
  eqs_STG_land_farmers_desc:0 "Unfortunately, the decades of Red rule appear to have brainwashed the common pony into being selfish, greedy creatures that have no respect for property owners. While the state will ensure that landlords are not abusing their tennants, measures must be taken to clamp down on squatting and unlawful occupation."
  eqs_STG_industry_privitise:0 "Privitisation of Industry"
  eqs_STG_industry_privitise_desc:0 "Across Equestria factory owners generiously provide employment and opportunity to the masses in need of work. Factory owners shoulder the bulk of the risk and dangers of factory management. There is little reason why this system should not be restored within Severyana. "
  eqs_STG_land_crown:0 "Crown Estates"
  eqs_STG_land_crown_desc:0 "Rather than sell off, or give away the land, the Equestrian Crown can simply keep it and use the funds it generates to support the state. Renting out land to tennants at a reasonable rate, and sheparding them from dangers, will keep ponies safe while turning a tidy profit for us."
  eqs_STG_land_crown_mech:0 "Invest in Mechanisation"
  eqs_STG_land_crown_mech_desc:0 "The region thrives under the guiding hooves of the Princesses, yet more can be done. By supplying tractors and new farming equipment to our subjects we can ensure they are able to continue to live happy, productive lives in peace and harmony."
  eqs_STG_crown_industry:0 "Royal Joint Stock Industries"
  eqs_STG_crown_industry_desc:0 "Not every industry needs to be full sold off to private hooves. By ensuring the Crown retains majority shares in the largest of the industrial concerns in the region, we can ensure that the conditions of 995 never happen again. The profit for the state coffers is only an added bonus, of course."
  eqs_STG_land_coop:0 "Maintain the Communes"
  eqs_STG_land_coop_desc:0 "Traditionally farms in Equestria would be run by large clans of earth ponies, organised together for the common good. The commune system we've found in Severyana seems to just be an evolution of this structure. There's no reason that we can't maintain it moving forwards."
  eqs_STG_land_coop_tractor:0 "Support Tractor Stations"
  eqs_STG_land_coop_tractor_desc:0 "While our decision to support their communal land ownership has been extremely popular amongst the locals, we can do more. If we were to set up machine tractor depots, and provide lines of credit to villages, we could rapidly mechanise agricultural production in the region. "
  eqs_STG_industrial_union:0 "Allow Worker Cooperatives"
  eqs_STG_industrial_union_desc:0 "As strange as it seems, the Severyanian model appears to work for them. Instead of a single pony taking the profits, or shouldering the hardships, the wealth and costs of running the factory are split amongst the ponies that work there. While strange, production does not seem to have been slowed by this."
  eqs_STG_modernise_industry:0 "Finish the Industrialisation"
  eqs_STG_modernise_industry_desc:0 "Severyana's potential was squandered under the communist regimes, but under our guiding hoof we can finally allow it to mature and become the industrial beacon it was always meant to be. Full electrification of the region will increase both productivity, and the standard of living for the local ponies."
  eqs_STG_oil:0 "Fuel Experiments"
  eqs_STG_oil_desc:0 "Severyana is not naturally blessed with much in the way of oil. The reds seemed to have realised this, and had drawn up several plans for deeper drilling of what little reserves do exist, combined with heavy investment into alternative fuel sources. We should consider looking into these plans."
  EQS_to_STG_railway:0 "Canterlot - Princessyn Railway"
  EQS_to_STG_railway_desc:0 "With the regions industry now once again up and running, it's about time we improved the transportation links between the regional capital and Canterlot, to ensure swift communication and ease of transport."
  STG_to_CRY_railway:0 "Crystal City - Princessyn Railway"
  STG_to_CRY_railway_desc:0 "Despite being neighbours, few links exist between Severyana and the Crystal Empire, owing to the latter's banishment by King Sombra for 1,000 years. We should help out our friends by building new networks to connect them to our lands."
  eqs_STG_trot:0 "Rebirth of Trottingham"
  eqs_STG_trot_desc:0 "With the return of Severyana to Equestria, Trottingham has seen a renewed period of economic growth and plenty. Once again the city acts as a hub of trade for resources traveling to and from the region and Griffonia."
  STG_royal_land:0 "A Royal province"
  STG_royal_land_desc:0 "Under the wise and motherly hoof of the Princesses, the region has once again become part of Equestria. Shielded from the lies of the Reds and the nobility that would ruin them, our little ponies are prospering under the loving gaze of the sun and moon."
  EQS_study_tanks:0 "Study their weapon designs"
  EQS_study_tanks_desc:0 "In and amongst archives of the former regime sits a number of interesting proposals for tank designs. While our own armour is, of course, superior, it wouldn't hurt for us to take some inspiration from the Reds where we can. No point reinventing the wheel."
  STG_commie_land:0 "Our Loyal Reds"
  STG_commie_land_desc:0 "While few believed it was possible, our fair treatment and support of the communes and workers organisations in the region has led to them whole heartedly accepting their future as part of Equestria. While some foreign states deny this as 'communist infiltration', we are simply happy that our little ponies have come home"
  eqs_peace:0 "Si Vis Pacem..."
  eqs_peace_desc:0 "Equestria is the industrial power house of Equus. If we want our new friends to be able to stand on their own hooves, we need to help them stand as tall as we do. Generosity goes a long way everypony."
  eqs_afield:0 "Harmony Beyond Equus"
  eqs_afield_desc:0 "We are not so shortsighted, nor selfish, to to stop caring about ponies and other creatures beyond our own front door. As we learned with our Kirin friends, friendship spans across the globe. We must ensure that everycreature has a change to live under friendship and harmony, no matter where they are. "
  eqs_war:0 "...Para Bellum"
  eqs_war_desc:0 "As the recent years have shown, friendship cannot be spread by good will alone. Equestria must be prepared to fight for its friendships, and to ensure that its allies are able to work with us towards that noble goal."
  eqs_paxref:0 "The End Of the Beginning"
  eqs_paxref_desc:0 "Equestria has awoken from it's long slumber. Yet what will the future hold for Equestria, and ponykind? Should ponykind spread harmony to all others, or return to slumber now that it is safe? Only a referendum can decide the future of Equestria... "
  eqs_pax:0 "Pax Harmoniae"
  eqs_pax_desc:0 "The last decade has shown us that Equestria cannot afford to ignore the wider world. Harmony at home can only be protected if we ensure it spreads to our neighbours, lest we be once again threatened and undermined by monsters seeking conquest. We must prepare to defend harmony across Equus from whomever would threaten it! For Friendship!"
  eqs_pax_crystals:0 "The Crystal Empire"
  eqs_pax_crystals_desc:0 "Ever since Cadance was driven out of the Crystal Empire, we have had little interaction with our former subject in the North. We should send our agents north to get a better understanding of what is occuring amongst the snow and ice."
  eqs_pax_crystal_communism:0 "Red Crystals"
  eqs_pax_crystal_communism_desc:0 "The ‘Crystal Revolution’ as it were was rather bloodless. Indeed, the Crystal Ponies simply vote in a referendum to replace poor Cadance with their own elected rulers. Do we have any right to stop them from deciding to follow this path, even if it is into communism?"
  eqs_pax_crystal_communism_ally:0 "Our Socialist Friends?"
  eqs_pax_crystal_communism_ally_desc:0 "We may not understand, nor agree with, the decisions of the Crystal Ponies, yet we must respect them all the same. In the spirit of friendship, Princess Celestia has formally offered to cooperate with the new worker’s republic and invite them into the Harmonic Accords."
  eqs_pax_crystal_communism_war:0 "Restore Order in the North"
  eqs_pax_crystal_communism_war_desc:0 "The Crystal Ponies have been overtaken by madness. They cannot be allowed to throw away centuries of traditions, culture, laws and order for the sake of insane conspiratorial rhetoric. Mobile the armed forces, we will restore sanity to the north."
  eqs_pax_crystal_sombra:0 "Banish Sombra"
  eqs_pax_crystal_sombra_desc:0 "Sombra is the cruellest tyrant of Equestrian history. A brutal monster that enslaves anypony he can for his own foul ends. We cannot let this stand. We must strike forth in the name of harmony and once again cast him into the dustbin of history."
  eqs_pax_birbisland:0 "The issue of Les Meridiennes"
  eqs_pax_birbisland_desc:0 "Ever since the Aquelian revolution, the islands of Les Meridiennes have been left forsaken and abandoned by their former overlords. We should reach out to them, offering economic support in exchange for a new stepping stone towards Zebrica."
  eqs_pax_bird:0 "The Griffin Colony"
  eqs_pax_bird_desc:0 "Founded in the 8th century ALB, the Griffon colony in Equus has been a dumping ground for political exiles, radicals and the dispossed flowing out of Griffonia. We should check in on them to see how they've developed without the empire lording over them."
  eqs_pax_bird_good:0 "The Harmonic Colony"
  eqs_pax_bird_good_desc:0 "Thankfully it seems that harmony and friendship has made its way into the hearts of our northern griffin neighbours. Despite political assassinations and strife, they have managed to come to adopt the principles of harmony that we hold so dear."
  eqs_pax_bird_evil:0 "Operation - Feathered Fiends"
  eqs_pax_bird_evil_desc:0 "Woefully, it seems our feathered neighbours have turned to disharmony and evil, following the assassination of their former ruler. We must stem in to help guide them back onto the path of friendship and joy for all."
  eqs_pax_bear_good:0 "Frozen Harmony"
  eqs_pax_bear_good_desc:0 "The reign of Queen Eira has seen the polar bears shed many of their more backwards, brutal ways, and led to the creation of a frozen kingdom with a unique system of harmony, not seen elsewhere on Equus. There is much we can learn from them, and their appreciation of nature. Let us shake hoof and paw with our new friends."
  eqs_pax_bear_evil:0 "Operation - Northern Joy"
  eqs_pax_bear_evil_desc:0 "We know that bears can learn harmony. Eira, the bear chieftess that lived for so many years with us in Equestria showed us as much. While we had hoped that she would be able to bring harmony to the ursines by herself, it seems that progressive forces in the frozen north will need our aid to ensure their liberation."
  eqs_pax_north:0 "The Penguin Kingdom"
  eqs_pax_north_desc:0 "The Frozen lands of the penguins is a land that Equestria has few contacts with. Despite the lack of official diplomacy, a number of our ponies have moved up into the frozen north to help modernise and develop the region. We should reach out to local elites to ensure our expats are cared for."
  eqs_deerpax:0 "The Olenian Issue"
  eqs_deerpax_desc:0 "While they were once savage raiders and pillagers, the deer of Olenia have recently become much more civilised. With the spread of the industrial revolution, and investment from Equestrian businesses, their frozen tundra has come to shine in its own way. We should send an embassy to encourage further relations."
  eqs_pax_deer_good:0 "Velvet Desires"
  eqs_pax_deer_good_desc:0 "Queen Velvet has been returned to the throne, and Olenia prospers in friendship and harmony. We should extend the hoof of formal friendship our to deer friends. Together we will be strong!"
  eqs_pax_deer_evil:0 "Operation - Captive Cervidae"
  eqs_pax_deer_evil_desc:0 "For too long the deer of Olenia have suffered under the rule of corrupt tyrants. It is our duty to help restore the rightful ruler of this land, and to ensure that harmony, friendship and freedom can be spread to everydeer!"
  eqs_pax_bug:0 "The Changedlings"
  eqs_pax_bug_desc:0 "The changelings were the biggest threat Equestria had ever faced. A cruel, hungry species of predators that wanted to destroy us. Yet now their swords have become ploughshares, their guns destroyed and harmony has come to spread amongst them. Perhaps now peace will finally come to Equus."
  eqs_pax_bear:0 "The Bear Kingdom"
  eqs_pax_bear_desc:0 "The Polar Bears are a strange set of creatures, one that Equestria knows little about. Much like ourselves, they too have recently begun to modernise and revolutionise their society to adapt to the changing world. We should send diplomatic envoys to them in order to express our desire for friendship and cooperation."
  eqs_yak:0 "The Yak Khans"
  eqs_yak_desc:0 "The Yaks are a contentious set of creatures who love to smash and show off their strength. Thankfully, Pinkie Pie proved to us all that they can get along with ponies pretty well. We should send an embassy up north to further improve relations with them."
  eqs_pax_yak_evil:0 "Operation - Mountain Freedom"
  eqs_pax_yak_evil_desc:0 "Despite our best efforts, Yakyakistan has fallen under the sway of un-harmonic, hostile forces. Unfortunately, we are going to have to strike them before they can come to threaten our ponies in the future. May we be forgiven for what we must do."
  eqs_pax_yak_good:0 "Reach out to the Yaks"
  eqs_pax_yak_good_desc:0 "Good has triumphed in the homelands of our Yak friends. Now that their civil scuffle over leadership has ended, we should reach out to them and invite them into our alliance. By working together we can ensure a better future for pony and yak alike."
  eqs_our_bug:0 "To Change the Changelings"
  eqs_our_bug_desc:0 "The war against the changelings was harsh. Many ponies lost their lives, and Equestria was changed forever. But we will not give up harmony, nor will we give in to hatred. The warmonger, Chrysalis, who started the war is no more. The changelings deserve our pity, it is up to us to redeem them."
  eqs_friendly_bug:0 "Harmony On Chitin Wings"
  eqs_friendly_bug_desc:0 "No one had thought it possible, yet Thorax has proved himself as an effective leader of the changelings. Managing to overcome Chrysalis and dismantle the imperialistic military of the old hives, he has ensured that harmony has come to the changeling people at long last. A true friend of Equestria."
  eqs_pax_north_good:0 "The Ice Throne Thaws"
  eqs_pax_north_good_desc:0 "Wonderful news! The dictatorship in the north has finally crumbled, with revolutionaries and harmonists establishing a new, friendly, regime amongst the penguin population. We must reach out and shake flipper and hoof with our new found friends to aid them on their new journey. "
  eqs_pax_north_evil:0 "Operation - Frozen Progress"
  eqs_pax_north_evil_desc:0 "Despite our hopes, it seems that the penguin's progress towards harmony has been waylaid by evil that seeks to enslave the population. We must act, not only to protect our ponies, but to liberate our feathered friends from the evil that has fallen upon them."
  eqs_STGPAX:0 "Red Affairs"
  eqs_STGPAX_desc:0 "Stalliongrad has been a threat to Equestria ever since it’s inception. A revolutionary mob tearing down law and order for their own gain.

  eqs_osq_desc:0 "The Emirate of Osqat, unlike many of its peers, is a horse kingdom that has embraced the Equestrian model of friendship and harmonic rulership. They are a prime candidate for our support and friendship, and we should send a diplomatic mission to their Emir post haste."
  eqs_osqports:0 "Expand Our Presence"
  eqs_osqports_desc:0 "Now that the horses of Osqat are our allies, we have their permission to start the rapid transfer of troops and equipment into the region. Establishing naval bases will allow us to more easily move equipment across the region, while investment into the local economies will help enrich our new allies."
  eqs_osqmil:0 "Train their Forces"
  eqs_osqmil_desc:0 "While we have no wish to inflict war or suffering onto our friends, it would be wrong of us to leave them unprepared to face any threats that may arise in the near future. Sending a military mission to modernise their logistics and command structure will help our new friends to protect themselves, should the worst happen."
  eqs_osqeconomy:0 "Modernise their Industry"
  eqs_osqeconomy_desc:0 "Our existing investment into Osqat is already seeing fruit, but more can be done. By convincing Equestrian business interests to plant roots in Osqat, we can help to improve and expand the industrialisation of the region and raise living standards for our new allies. Prosperity awaits."
  eqs_osqoil:0 "Map Out New Oil Fields"
  eqs_osqoil_desc:0 "By sending Equestrian mappers and surveyors to the region, our advanced technology can be utilised to discover and develop previously untouched oilfields in the region. This will no doubt greatly please our allies by allowing them to better benefit from the wealth hidden underneath their hooves."
  eqs_emr:0 "The Four Emirs"
  eqs_emr_desc:0 "The conflict in Saddle Arabia has seen central authority fragment throughout the region. A prime example of this is the League of Four Emirs, headquartered in the city of Yabmanein. Representing the lands of four Emirs declaring neutrality in the nearby conflict, the realm has stagnated over the last few years. Something must be done."
  eqs_emrwar:0 "Expel the Emirs"
  eqs_emrwar_desc:0 "While the Emirs have kept the region safe from the fires of civil war, their rule has done little to better the lives of the local population. We cannot allow them to grow fat while the local equines continue to suffer under their misrule. Military action may be the only option to remedy this situation."
  eqs_emrcoup:0 "Change their Ways"
  eqs_emrcoup_desc:0 "The Emirs are open to trade, even if they are unwilling to pass the reforms their land desperately needs. By rallying harmonic forces through the land, and putting economic pressure upon the ruling elites, we can come to ensure that friendship is given a chance to flourish in the region."
  eqs_emroil:0 "Invite Equestrian Investors"
  eqs_emroil_desc:0 "Our existing investment into the region is already seeing fruit, but more can be done. By convincing Equestrian business interests to plant roots in their lands, we can help to improve and expand the industrialisation of the region and raise living standards for our new allies. Prosperity awaits."
  eqs_emroil2:0 "Modernise their Equipment"
  eqs_emroil2_desc:0 "The industrial equipment utilised in the region for drilling and processing crude oil, not to mention discovering new oil fields, is decades out of date and is seriously hampering production. Much can be done to increase our new friend’s income, if only we provide them with some simple aid."
  eqs_emrfriendship:0 "Aid for Every Creature"
  eqs_emrfriendship_desc:0 "The ongoing flow of refugees fleeing the civil war has led to appealing conditions within some of the border cities and has stretched the land’s resources to breaking point. We must be generous and send much needed aid to help these poor creatures."
  eqs_hmr:0 "The Haymirite Kingdom"
  eqs_hmr_desc:0 "The Haymirite Kingdom has, unfortunately, remained rather traditional in their approach to rulership, maintaining a tight grip upon the land. If we hope to bring the wonders of friendship to the population, we must find a way to open the country up to our influence. "
  eqs_hmrcoup:0 "A Soft Word"
  eqs_hmrcoup_desc:0 "Diplomacy, and trade negotiations with the leadership of Haymir can achieve without bloodshed what countless bombs and bullets may fail to do. There are alternatives to fighting after all, my little ponies. And where trade fails, S.M.I.L.E. can always help to nudge things in our favour."
  eqs_hmrwar:0 "A Firm Hoof"
  eqs_hmrwar_desc:0 "Haymirite autocracy is a nut. And like any nut, the best way to break the shell is with a nutcracker. The Equestrian armed forces can easily be that nutcracker. A lightning assault by paratrooper and marine forces would make short work of their armed forces and allow the liberation of the local population."
  eqs_middlerail1:0 "Improve their Transport Links"
  eqs_middlerail1_desc:0 "The regional rail network is staggeringly old fashioned. This lack of modern infrastructure has done much to limit the economic growth of the region and is making it far harder for our forces to stay properly supplied. By inviting Equestrian rail companies to improve the local situation we can fix both problems at the same time."
  eqs_middlerail2:0 "Invest in Local Ports"
  eqs_middlerail2_desc:0 "In order to ensure the swift transport of goods and supplies remains unimpeded, we have generously unveiled a new investment plan for the region. Ports at several key locations will be modernised and expanded, in order to allow for a greater volume of goods to be processed."
  eqs_middlerail3:0 "Bring the Railway to Karkadannistan"
  eqs_middlerail3_desc:0 "What railways do exist in the former khanate are horrifically backwards and do not even cover the entire nation. We must ensure that the major cities and ports are connected by modern rail networks, lest any operation there grinds to a halt."
  eqs_middlerail4:0 "Reconnect the Region's Markets"
  eqs_hmroil:0 "Haymir Investment"
  eqs_hmroil_desc:0 "By investing in the kingdom, we can help to improve and expand the industrialisation of the region and raise living standards for our new allies. This should go some way to helping clear up any bad blood that may have been accidentally created by our recent actions."
  eqs_hmrfriendship:0 "Lending A Helping Hoof"
  eqs_hmrfriendship_desc:0 "Despite rapid advanced in recent years, the local education system is a shallow imitition of the Equestrian model. By providing much needed funding and support to our new friends, we will ensure that their future remains bright and magical."
  eqs_hmroil2:0 "Expanding their Production"
  eqs_hmroil2_desc:0 "In contrasts to their neighbours, the Haymir lacks any natural oil deposits. Instead, much of the Kingdom’s wealth stems from it’s mining industry in the south. Providing them with new tools and skilled personnel will allow their mining operations to be further expanded, boosting the local economy."

The pegasus foal, who would later become known as Princess Mi Amore Cadenza, was found in a forest close to Vanhoover by her earth pony adopted parents. Taken to a nearby village, it was a peaceful, calm life until one day, a jealous sorceress named Prismia stole the love of the villagers using a malevolent magical necklace. The young Cadance confronted Prismia and turned her own magic against her, causing her to change her horrible ways. Afterward, Princess Celestia recognised her power, adopted her as her niece and elevated Cadance as the alicorn Princess of Love.\n\nThereafter, Cadance became a foalsitter for Princess Celestia's newest personal student, Twilight Sparkle. She would meet and fall in love with Twilight's older brother, Shining Armour. Their wedding day was going to be perfect, but unfortunately, the scheming Chrysalis, Queen of the Changelings used the opportunity to impersonate Cadance and seize control of Equestria by guile. Despite the presence of a large changeling host and their empowered Queen, Princess Cadance and Shining Armour used the power of their love to cast the changelings out of the country.\n\nWhen the Crystal Empire reappeared, Celestia sent Cadance to rule over it, knowing her to be a descendant of Princess Amore, its last ruler before Sombra's reign. Cadance made her stand there, defeating the nascent shadow of King Sombra that lingered after his banishment by using a mythical artefact called the Crystal Heart. With their success, she and Shining Armour have safekept the land ever since, siring a foal named Flurry Heart along the way."

    equestriabat.1.d:0 "Carrot Stick slumped forwards against the bar’s countertop, nursing the drink held between his hooves. He shouldn’t have been surprised. Chiropterra’s sins were numerous, a black stain on the history of ponykind. Even he himself was not without guilt. He had served the Nightmare’s hoof, done his duty for the Night. The only reason he wasn’t rotting in Tartarus with the rest of the leadership was his record of objections to the harsh measures undertaken by the others, his refusal to issue the orders the others did and his attempts at internal reformism. To even think that the Equestrians would have let him run a new state, to trust Chiropterrans to govern themselves? Madness.\n\nAnd yet the harsh rejection of his plan by Princess Luna stung all the same. Like a lance through his very soul, the very princess that guided the moon itself rejecting him and his people’s chance to redeem themselves. Denouncing them, stating that they could not be trusted to govern themselves, lest they return to the ways of evil and hatred.\n\nHe took another long sip of his drink."

The bravado, dreams and plans had died the moment a sniper’s bullet had turned his sergeant’s head into red mist. Despite what the propaganda had claimed they’d been utterly unprepared for the Equestrian assault, unable to match the industrial might crashing down against them in a rain of shells, magical firepower and steel.\nHe wasn’t sure how he’d been captured. One moment he’d been hiding in his foxhole, clinging to the remains of his best friend, the next he had woken in an Equestrian medical tent, being tended to before being shipped off to a prisoner camp. It didn’t make any sense. The tales said that the Equestrians were heartless monsters, cultists of the Sun that would burn any bat they found. Yet they had saved his life, they granted the prisoners rations equal to their own and didn’t even beat them. Even more perplexing were the thestrals in equestrian uniform with odd accents that watched them with curiosity and pity.\n\nBut all that had ended now. Now they were being released, being let go, demobilised. Granted a few months of back pay by the new regime, a few ration packs and then sent back to their homes, to return them to civilian life. He knew that some of his comrades wanted to keep fighting, to flee into the jungles, to take up arms. But what would be the point? Everything he knew was a lie. It was time to start again, to go home, to finally ask out that sweet mare he’d had his eyes on. To hope the screaming in his dreams finally stopped."

Given rations and lodgings, dropped off in some distant village, countless miles away from home. The thestrals that lived there had been welcoming enough, greeting him, bringing him in, making him part of their life. Yet everything felt wrong. Their accents strange, their faith heretical.

Sugar Plum grumbled to herself as she sipped her lemonade, glancing out at the growing neighbourhood from her porch. When she’d left the military and her captaincy behind, the Crown had offered her and countless others a plot of land in this new continent of theirs. With little other prospects waiting her back in civilian life she’d accepted the offer and had come to find herself transplanted into a strange new frontier in dire need of civilisation.\n\nIt could have been worse, she thought to herself, musing as she watched the others going about their day. With the land and supplies provided by the Crown they had carved out a decent spot from the jungle, and the guidance from some retired members of the Lunar Guard ensured that they were well prepared to handle the worst of the heat and climate.

A plot of land, free transport for herself and her belongings, and no taxes for the first year of settlement. It was an opportunity she couldn’t pass up. Nor could thousands of others from the southeast, pouring across the ocean to stake their claim in the lands of Equestria’s newest frontier. A land so similar, yet different to their own home.

Pragmatic necessity mixed with fanatical faith has ensured that the cultists continued to recruit and preach their foul madness to the very populations they had enslaved. Faced between the choice of continued enslavement, or eventually freedom for their grandfoals, many natives came to collaborate with the former regime in hope of better treatment. Yet for every zebra unwillingly forced into service, there was another that converted out of pure faith and belief in the nightmare. The issue of what to do with these collaborators weighs heavily on the minds of the princesses… "

Each new moment in his life had ripped away something he thought he had known about the time preceding it. When invaders had come to the land, ponies dressed in gold and white, he had not hoped for much, expecting one leash to be changed for another.\n\nTo his surprise, they had instead freed him. Freed all the slaves, providing them with food, healthcare and even housing them in property formerly owned by the Chiropterran leadership. Yet even then, he had not been truly free. The newcomers, the Equestrians, had needed time to process him and all the others, to understand what had occurred to them. He had been brought to interview after interview, called up to give testimony in court, to pick out his former overlords from line ups and report their crimes. Yet finally, he was free. Granted citizenship of this new land and a chance to start afresh. He was finally the master of his own fate once more."

It had not been a glamorous job yet it had paid enough to keep bread on the table, to keep his family well fed and housed. And now it was gone. Dismantled and torn away, across the ocean, as had every other trace of industry in Firstport. They’d tried to resist, to form a workers militia to stop the leeches from stealing their work, but they’d been no match for the stunning spells of the occupation force. Left unharmed, yet with a shattered ego, he had nothing left. No options remained for him in the city. For anyone. They’d have to return to the jungles, to move back into his wife’s home village, to toil and trundle as farmers to try and survive.\n\nSuch was the ‘justice’ that the cursed equestrians brought to his home."

First established as a warehouse two centuries prior, in the last decade it had been transformed into an arms factory, churning out shell after shell, round after round for the Chiropterran war machine. And now its purpose was once more altered. Gone were the explosives, the stink of cordite and nitroglycerin, the guards and propaganda posters. Now stood strange machinery that turned ores and metals into multicoloured toys, packages and gifts for pastel ponies the world over. No more did a legionary officer sit watch, place taken instead by a overweight overseer shipped in from Equestria to supervise production. "

Yet the pale pegasus mare nursing her drink at the bar did not complain. S.M.I.L.E. work was never meant to be easy, yet when Trinket’s superiors had assigned her to the region, she had expected something a little more. Battles and firefights with deluded terrorists, assassination strikes against mad-warlords. Not hanging out in a dingy, run down bar in the midst of the jungle, waiting for a contact that may never appear.\n\n“It’s shit, but it works well enough for us.”\n\nThe sudden voice from her left threw her off guard, the mare’s wings flaring out in alarm as she reached for her concealed pistol, turning to observe the threat.\n\n“Your bosses aren’t going to like it if you do that. We’re on the same side.” Explained the creamy white coloured earth pony as he raised his hooves up to show he was unarmed. Despite the sun already starting to set outside, a pair of dark sunglasses adorned his muzzle, reflecting her own gaze back at her. “In fact, you’re going to want to take that to them. It’ll help deal with the bastards in hiding.” He added, nodding down at the table, gesturing to a folder that hadn’t been there a moment ago.\n\n“Understood,” said the agent, collecting the folder with one hoof, yet keeping her eye on him all the same. “You’re good.

Then on Hearth's Warming Eve, after she'd been a good pony all year and when she finally was gonna get what she deserved...\n\nHer parents gave her Waddles, a giant coconut crab. Waddles wasn't cute or fast, and when she tried to play fetch with him he just stared. Or she thought he just stared? She wasn't even sure where his eyes were...or if it was a he.\n\nThere was one thing though that Waddles could do that a dog could not; she'd also gotten a genuine 'crab saddle' with him. It took more than a few weeks to get Waddles to let her try it out, but after a few bribes of spoiled sweets and extra shell scrubs; Honey Dew found herself loving her new best friend.\n\nOther ponies might have dogs or cats, but when it was time to play Guards and Bandits; Honey Dew was always picked first! Everypony in school wanted the mare with the personal monster on her side. Her and Waddles led the Guards to victory everytime! He wasn't a pet for long, but Waddles was her battle buddy and friend!"

The Equestrians were kind and generous, setting up in the village square and starting to hand out rations and supplies. Flour, canned goods, preserved fruits and vegetables, medicine, even the odd box of sweets for foals to enjoy. She’d wanted to be cautious, to be wary of this being some trap, but the empty stomachs of her foals had forced her to accept. She couldn’t let them starve. \n\nHer fears proved baseless.

First the villagers had torn down his proclamations and heckled his heralds. Then the Baron had brought in his thugs, hired muscle from Griffonia. They’d cracked down on anypony showing resistance, intimidating old mares and chasing away petty vandals. The tension rose, air simmering between the two sides, tit for tat assaults and retaliations; vandalism met with curfew, robbery with interrogations, assaults with arrests. Then the Baron issued his newest proclamation, claiming that the villagers owed his family two decades of rent, alongside compensation for the damages suffered by them during the revolution and their exile. \n\nIt was the last straw.\n\nWhen the next aid delivery convoy from the Equestrian Guard arrived the villagers put their plan into action, counting on the presence of the Equestrian Military to keep the Baron’s thugs in line. Banners held high, marching as one, shouting their slogans, the villagers protested the baron’s policies and denounced his rule, screaming his sins into the air. The Baron’s thugs, an outnumbered band of griffons, reacted in the only way they knew how. Weapons drawn, screamed orders to disperse, threats of being fired upon. All the while the royal guardsmares were stuck in the middle, frantically trying to calm down both sides. \n\nA shot rang out. A teenage mare, little more than a filly, fell to the ground, her placard falling into the mud with her. Smoke rose from the barrel of a Griffin’s rifle.\nThe crowd surged forwards, pent up anger and rage unleashed in a single moment. Flooding over and around the halpless guardsmares, forced to hide within their truck lest they be torn to shreds, falling upon the Baron’s thugs with a fury non would expect from simple ponies.\n\nOnce his minions were beaten down, the crowd carried on, dragging the Baron out from his lair.

The father, an old, withered stallion looked upon his daughter, a vibrant pegasus mare, pleading, before glancing to her new companions that were gathered in the clearing. A sorry sight met his eyes. Little more than bandits draped in torn red banners and the remnants of once proud uniforms, a mix match of weaponry and explosives adorning their flanks.\n\n “Dad, I have to do this. We’ll be safe, okay? We’re just hitting a few supply convoys. You’re heard about how chickenshit the patrols are. We’ll just scare them, take their stuff, then bring it back to the village.

Current increases are inline with previous economic predictions taken from our Red predecessors in the region, thought this growth rate is not expected to last once the post-war rebuilding efforts end. Current economic models predict that the regions industrial output may lag behind standard Equestrian production rates by 2-5%, owing to the uncompetitive nature of unionised industries.

A portion of the state-owned land inherited from the communist regime will be returned to former landowners, in exchange for generous donations to the Equestrian treasury, and the rest will be auctioned off to the highest bidder. This option will rapidly alleviate the economic costs of rebuilding the region yet will undoubtably inflame local opinion. \n\nThe second option is much more radical. The land would be granted to the farming villages, family clans, communes and other such groups that work the land. What the Red state had promised would eventually occur would be made into reality overnight. This idea is extremely unpopular amongst the conservative elements of Equestria yet would go a long way to win over the locals to our side. \n\nThe third option is that of continuity. The Crown would take replace the Supreme Soviet as the sole owner of public land within the region and would have direct access to the agricultural surplus produced. In exchange the Crown would take on the burden of providing aid, support and protection to the ponies who work the land."

The gathered delegates from the Severyanian cities publicly paid homage to the alicorn sisters, declaring them to be ‘defenders of Equestria’ and ‘champions of all harmony’, and thanked them for their efforts in restoring their lands. Despite this strange display, the following week of conferences, receptions and meetings largely proceeded without issue, the Severyanian delegation made an a show of vigorously supporting any and all opinions put forth by the royal sisters. At the end of the conference the two sisters held a speech thanking everypony for coming all the way to Canterlot and promised increased attention upon local issues in the coming years."

Yet the fates had smiled upon her. The new plan of the Royal Sisters, approved by the Equestrian population, aimed to put Equestria back on the map.

    equestriadiarchy.7.d:0 ""The Jungles, Lulu, really?" asked Celestia, sighing as she floated another bite of sliced pineapple over to herself. "I admire your dedication, but you have to realise that no pony is going to build in the jungles. The logistical nightmare alone would stunt any development. At least the coast can transport things via their ports." \n\n "And force ponies out of their homes and into the cities? That's just as bad as forcing them to move into the North. The tribal identities and cultural history would be destroyed in a generation, if not more." Countered the Night Princess, stabbing at her pancake with a fork "Tia, you mean well, but I fear you've spent too much time with administrators and not enough with the ponies on the ground." She added, before taking a bite of her pancake. "New recepie?" \n\n "New Mareland Style, and I suppose you may have a point. Still, we have to think about how these investments are going to shape out in the future, in a decade, in a century, not just how it will effect the ponies here and now, Lulu...""

"Weren't you opposed to continuing to continued industrial build up, Lulu? Now you want us to push our funding into...tractor development?" n/ "I'd have prefered the South, yes, but if we are to pour more money into the North, we may as well improve our strengths. The [] rebels have pro-" \n "Stalliongradian." \n "Tia, please, don't humour t-" \n "Ahaha," Celestia chided, raising a hoof, "They have as much right to their own identity as any other pony, even if they are misguided." \n Luna rolled her eyes. "Okay, the Stalliongradians," she said, almost spitting the word as if it burnt her tongue, "have proven that tractor factories can be converted into military production with extreme ease. We must be able to bang our ploughshares into swords, if the need arises.""

    equestriadiarchy.9.d:0 "While all power in Equestria, in theory, lay with the hooves of Princess Celestia, over the centuries she had come depend on the Equestrian civil service and court officials, not to mention the numerous delegates of mayors from across Equestria, to ensure that royal will was translated into something tangible for the common pony. With the return of Princess Luna to the political scene as her sister's equal, things have only gotten more complicated. A multitude of factions have sprung up within the Royal Court, forcing the princesses to rally those they can behind them in order to push their visions of the future upon the wheezing state apparatus."

    equestriadiarchy.10.d:0 "During our development of the southern jungles, teams of royal engineers have stumbled across several caches of oddly well preserved military equipment and supplies. Stranger, they bare insigna and identification numbers that match no make or model produced in Equestria, or our allies. The military is at a loss as to where these caches came from, but after testing and checking for traps they have been intergrated into the supply network. "

    equestriadiarchy.11.t:0 "More caches Discovered!"
    equestriadiarchy.11.d:0 "As we have continued to develop and transform the Southern Jungles, several more caches of previously hidden supplies and weapons have been discovered. While this equipment appears older than the previous finds, its existence remains concerning. Local commanders have intensified their jungle patrols in hopes of discovering more of these caches, or better yet, whomever left them here to begin with."
    equestriadiarchy.11.a:0 "Who stockpiles guns in the jungle?"
    equestriadiarchy.12.t:0 "Everything is normal?"
    equestriadiarchy.12.d:0 "Despite our forces heightened alertness levels, no new caches or weapons or equipment have been found in the jungle. Even with the help of tribal elders and warband search parties, no trace can be found of any further equipment, nor whom it may have come from. The trail appears to have gone cold. The South is more stable than it has been in decades, and there doesn't seem to be anything for us to worry about."
    equestriadiarchy.12.a:0 "We may never know who did this..."
    equestriadiarchy.13.t:0 "The Lunar investigation"
    equestriadiarchy.13.d:0 "Despite months of searching, interrogation, investigation and even the involvement of Princess Luna herself, we're no step closer to finding just who, or where, the strange caches of weapons and supplies found in the jungle came from. Left over supplies by local bat ponies has been ruled out, as has activities of Changeling or Stalliongradian agents. It's as if the heavens themselves dropped them down into the jungles."
    equestriadiarchy.13.a:0 "Keep searching! Leave no stone unturned."
    equestriadiarchy.13.b:0 "Give up the search."
    equestriadiarchy.13.t:0 "We found a lead"
    equestriadiarchy.13.d:0 "With the continued patronage and aid of Princess Luna, our investigators have finally made a break through. The half sunken wreck of a Tobruck cargo freighter off the coast of Baltimare was discovered, containing several sets of equipment similar to those we had discovered in the jungle, alongside several thestral corpses. Sealed documents found aboard the vessel shows that it appears to have come from Northern Zebrica, north of Maregypt. Little is known about that region, especially after the Storm King plundered his way across the continent. Still, by sending an expedition to trace the vessel's course, we may yet be able to find out who is behind all this."

    equestriadiarchy.15.t:0 "Military aid for the expedition?"
    equestriadiarchy.15.d:0 "Several members of the Lunar Guard have expressed their concerns about the safety of the expedition and have requested that they be able to accompany them on their voyage. Upgrading the expedition's defences and firepower will certainly ensure their safety, but can Equestria really afford to spend its ponypower on what many are calling a madmare's errand?"
    equestriadiarchy.15.a:0 "Send a detachtment of the Luna Guard"
    equestriadiarchy.15.b:0 "Equestria can't spare the troops"
    equestriadiarchy.16.t:0 "Expedition Vanishes"
    equestriadiarchy.16.d:0 "The expedition sent to Northern Zeberica appears to have vanished. Their ship has missed its scheduled check ins and magical scrying can detect nothing. It is as if the ship has simply vanished from the face of the globe."

    equestriadiarchy.17.t:0 "Discovery of Chiropterra"
    equestriadiarchy.17.d:0 "The expedition has returned, with shocking news! When tracing the path of the mystery freighter along the coast they came under repeated assault by sea and air by bands of armed and bloodthirsty thestrals. Only by the valiant struggle of the Lunar Guard were these attacks repulsed, and not without losses. Rigorous interrogation of the captives taken revealed that these mad ponies appear to be some form of Nightmare Cultist, part of an organised state of rebels and traitors plotting to corrupt the princess and revive their foul diety. They have now safely returned to Equestrian habour, leaving the Princesses to deal with this shocking turn of events."
    equestriadiarchy.17.a:0 "What fresh hell is this?"
    equestriadiarchy.18.t:0 "A New Kind of War"
    equestriadiarchy.18.d:0 "Colonel Cloud Windshaper took a deep swig of tea before returning to his map. The whole region around Ursagrad was full of Chiropterran guerillas, yet he couldn't seem to pin them down in any location. Every enemy attack caught his forces completely by surprise. Not even command of the air could help his forces, the bat's own flight abilities allowing them to flee just as fast as his command could pursue. \n\nThe colonel's thoughts were interrupted by the sound of a patrol returning. He opened his tent flap and saw a platoon of Pegasi leading dozens of ponies into camp.\n"Lieutenant!" he cried, approaching the lead mare, "What is the meaning of this?"\nThe lieutenant, a much younger pony, had a crazed look in his eyes. "We lost three of our number to snipers as we passed by their village, so we marched in and took every able bodied bat prisoner. At least one of them's gotta be a guerilla, and the rest are guilty of helping hide 'em."\nColonel Windshaper sighed. "Very well, detain them for now and I'll deal with it later."\n\nAs the colonel moved back towards the tent, he heard screaming near the edge of the camp. Rushing to the scene, he found two soldiers holding back a very old mare.\n"Let me in!" she shrieked, "Give him back! I have to find him!"\n"Calm down ma'am," the colonel said, motioning for the guards to release her. "Who do you need to find?"\n"My son! You took him, give him back!" the mare said, breaking down in tears. "Please, he's my only son! Don't kill him, I beg you!"\n\nThe colonel was speechless. If they were ever going to have a chance at pacifying Chiropterra, they would need to win over the hearts and minds of these ponies. But every step they took to combat the insurgents only alienated the population further. Colonel Windshaper could see this vicious cycle spiraling out of control before his eyes. If something doesn't change soon..."

    equestriadiarchy.19.d:0 "Despite some Field Commanders arguing for trials to be held in Chiropterran territory, under their own laws, in order to showcase to the public how legal the crimes of the rebel's leadership had been, heavy pressure from Princess Luna has ensured that the political and military leadership of the Chiropterran state will have their fates decided in Equestria, under Equestrian law. \n\n Treason against the Equestrian state, attempted assassination of Princess Luna, slavery, murder, assault, extrajudicial assassination of dissidents, bribery, crimes against Equestrian life, crimes against non-equestrian life, cultural genocide, forced conversions, etc etc etc. The list continued ever onwards. The trials lasted for weeks, with live broadcasts by radio issued to the wider world. Evidence from Zebras, Equestrian Thestrals and most damning of all, Chiropterra's own archives ensured that there could only be one possible verdict. \n\n Guilty. \n\n Sentenced to banishment into the pits of Tartarus, the punishment preformed personally by Princess Luna. The widespread publicity the leadership's crimes, combined with the efforts of Equestrian Moonspeakers have done much to undermine the efforts of the cultist insurgency that plagues the land."

They had been meant to reach their destination an hour ago, yet incompetence, or perhaps, sabotage, from their native guide had caused them to miss several turns they'd needed to take. It was almost as it the country didn't want them t- \n\n "Captain, here." \n The report from the driver snapped him out of his thoughts, Wave grunted an acknowledgment before exiting the truck, gathering up her troops that were dismounting from the rear. Before them lay a village, seemingly deserted, its inhabitants in hiding, no doubt. She didn't like it, it reeked of an ambush. Yet orders were orders. Carefully, the squad swept through the empty plaza of the village, before bringing up the cargo from the rear of the convoy. Medicial supplies, processed foodstuffs, toys for foals and fillies. And of course, informational brouches printed in the native tongue. Wave wasn't sure if this would help pacify the region, but it had to be better than just shooting everypony. She waited in vain, yet no ponies emerged from the village. With a defeated sigh, she ordered her troops back onto the trucks, then turned and departed from the village. \n\n\n As the trucks left, Wave glanced back through the rear view mirror, catching a glimpse of a gaggle of excited bat pony foals starting to play with the toys. Perhaps this plan would work after all.  "

Leather exclaimed, "I never would've passed up an opportunity to meet my long lost Chiropterran kin."\n"Yeah, that's great, but try to move more quietly. These mad-ponies have been launching attacks near constantly on any patrol they can find."\nLeather sighed. "Have you considered that maybe you have so much trouble here because you're marching into their villages armed to the teeth and demanding information?"\n\nThe platoon caught sight of a village, and before he could be told not to, Leather Drums darted right in. The villagers were all in hiding, but when they realized that the stranger was not another brutish trooper they began to emerge.\n"Who are you?" asked a sickly colt.\n"I'm Leather Drums, a Moonspeaker from Ayacachtli."\n"Do you mean New Ayacachtli?"\n"No, old Ayacachtli, back in Equestria."\n\nGasps and quiet murmurs filled the village. "Are you with the Lunarists?" said a young mare.\n"Yes."\n"Why?" she asked, horrified.\n"I promise they're not bad ponies.

It was hoped that this summit could help to showcase the strides Equestria had taken in elevating its  thestral population to equal status in the last year. Princess Twilight Sparkle was once again responsible for organizing the event. The last summit held in 1005 had almost been an embarrasing fiasco, so extra precautions were made to ensure everything would go smoothly. This time there would be no giant gemstone statue due to the last summit's incident.\n\nThe summit ended up being almost as large as the last one, with delegates from over fifty cities and towns arriving in the capital. There were three days of conferences, receptions and meetings, with Princesses attending them actively. Representatives spoke openly of issues in their home towns: Mayor Ash Moustache's delegate from Baltimare spoke of the rising influence of anarcho-syndicalist CAN-TER, Mayor Goldwin's delegate from Vanhoover said something had to be done about Stalliongradian infiltration of the navy stationed in the city, Mayor Rokenhar's delegate from Las Pegasus spoke of the corruption and greed of local companies, representatives of other south-western cities complained of neglect from the central government while the delegates of the south-eastern chieftains largely praised the princesses and their recent efforts to better integrate the thestral population into Equestria. Most ominously, the delegate from Acornage warned of ever-growing Changeling military activity on the border. The Princesses took note of all the issues and promised that they would be taken care of.\n\nThe rest of the summit was spent making trade deals, celebrating the local cultures of Equestria's numerous cities, holding speeches on matters of economy and politics and discussing the events of the world at large. Attempts to formalise and plan grand strategies for the upcoming year met with failure and argument over the exact powers and authority held by the Crown compared to local government. Despite this Princess Luna held a speech thanking everypony for coming all the way to Canterlot and said that as long as the cities of Equestria worked together in harmony, the country as a whole would have a bright and prosperous future."

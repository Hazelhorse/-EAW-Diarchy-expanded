 cocopommel_add_tt: "Because of her Manehattan origins, Coco Pommel is being seen as pro-lunarist despite her political neutrality. As such, appointing her will slightly strengthen §BLunarist§! faction at the court!" #thank to Roserado
 EQS_advisor.4.t: "Arrival from the Megalopolis" #coco
 EQS_advisor.4.d: "Arriving by train from her Manehattan residence, Coco Pommel's heart thundered in her chest as she disembarked at Canterlot Station. She glanced back down against the letter she clutched against her chest; royal seal still attached. An invitation to join the Equestrian government, to work with the civil service and the crown in helping to develop and manage Equestria's industry. She'd never expected to rise this far, always assuming her origins from the seedier parts of Manehattan, not to mention her earth pony nature, would count against her in high society.\n\nShe was pleasantly surprised that Canterlot wasn't anywhere near as bad as she'd feared. Ponies seemed warm and welcoming, and while some did give her odd looks and curious glances as she'd entered the palace, most had been pleasant enough. It wasn't till she'd gotten into the depths of the palace proper, while fidgeting and squirming on her seat in a waiting room, that she noticed the hushed whispers and strained snippets of conversation. There were Mutterings about her Manehattan background[appoint_cocopommel_diarchy_2]. She frowned for a moment before composing herself, doing her best to keep her nerves under control as she waited for her appointment with the Princesses.[appoint_cocopommel_diarchy]" # I love your horsewords so much !
 appoint_cocopommel_diarchy_2_sl: ", theories about her being another 'Lunarist' being sent into pad out the administration"
 appoint_cocopommel_diarchy_sl: "\n\nCoco would never realise this herself but her appointment had coincided with the arrival of a number of new thestral bureaucrats in the city. Given that Manehattan had been central to Princess Luna's campaign for promoting thestral rights, rumours had started to spread that Coco was the unofficial leader of the new Lunarist faction that had started to develop. While the rumours had no basis in reality, their mere existence seems to have emboldened the Lunarist elements at court, comforting them with the false knowledge of widespread support from the wider population."
 EQS_advisor.4.a: "Regardless, She had proved herself."

 EQS_advisor.400.t: "Coco in Canterlot?" #cocopommel event chain 1
 EQS_advisor.400.d: "As the days passed, Coco would find herself being increasingly requested to aid in projects from the Lunarist faction of the court. Helping to design new bat pony fashions, military funding, diverting of resources to special projects etc. How will she proceed?"
 EQS_advisor.400.a: "Coco firmly rejects the offers to involve herself in petty court factionalism"
 EQS_advisor.400.b: "Coco politely declines the requests"
 EQS_adv_400b_tt: "She would continue to avoid this situation, so there will be no change in the balance of power."
 EQS_advisor.400.c: "She is more than happy to help them"
 
 flim_flam_add_tt: "The Flim Flam brothers are eager to get involved in Princess Luna's militarisation plans, offering their patented engine designs and factories to aid the nation. Appointing them will slightly strengthen $get_lunarist$ faction at the court!"
 EQS_advisor.5.t: "Art of Business" #flim_flam
 EQS_advisor.5.d: "Despite their less than stellar reputation, the engineering talents of the Flim Flam brothers are something that Equestria cannot afford to waste. While their desires for ‘Flim Flam Bug Zapper 9000’ are a tad too unreasonable for our tastes, their business experience and mechanical knowledge will no doubt help our economy in the long run.

 EQS_advisor.5.a: "I'm sure this won't backfire on us at all, right?"

 EQS_advisor.50.t: "A Shady Offer" #(being fired 33-36 days after his appointment or by on_actions_EQS_diarchy.txt)
 EQS_advisor.50.d: "The Flim Flam brother’s dishonest nature is well known. Too well known. It seems that several minor officials from the royal court have approached them, trying to gain aid for their political factions in exchange for cash."

 EQS_advisor.510.t: "An Unexpected Overture"
 EQS_advisor.510.d: "\"Er, how do I do that...\"\n\nApplejack was in a dilemma as she received the letter from Canterlot and read the contents. What the tartarus did this mean, she wondered, since she was already very busy with Sweet Apple Acres[eqsdiarchy_advisor_510_serve]. This letter from Canterlot announced her appointment as Chief of the newly organised National Audit Office. Was it really necessary for Princesses to put Applejack in this position? Applejack had no way of knowing.[eqsdiarchy_advisor_510_twi]\n\nAs She had heard from her friends about what was going on in Equestria, it seemed like this letter was all because of the Flim Flam Brothers and their [FF_GetSolLun] lackeys. Perhaps Applejack had been appointed because she had caught the Brothers in their tricks so many times? On the other hoof, she could still vividly recall how she thought her family was going to lose the Sweet Apple Acres because of the Flim Flam Brothers' apple cider fiasco.\n\nEventually she went to the post office, sent a reply saying she would accept the invitation gladly." #Now I regret cooking those event chain since I had to commit my shitty horseapplewords.
 eqsdiarchy_advisor_510_serve_yes: " and her current service for the Equestrian Army. It was really tough days so much adjusting to militarised steed life, and then this.."
 eqsdiarchy_advisor_510_twi_yes: " Twilight and her other friends worked for the government too, so if she had any problem with something she would have to do, she might be able to ask her friends about them."
 EQS_advisor.510.a: "I'm pretty curious if she would do something of those paperwork \"gladly\" as well."

 EQS_advisor.52.t: "Flim-Flam Apprehension" #take that decision
 EQS_advisor.52.d: "Under the leadership of Applejack, the element of Honesty, the crimes of the Flim-Flam brothers have been discovered and the duo tracked down, charged and dealt with. They, along with everyone else involved have been found, fined and sentenced to community service for their misdeeds."
 EQS_advisor.52.a: "Applejack has a bright future ahead of her in our government!" #you get her better.

 #EQS_advisor.53.t: "Every Evidence Has Been Collected" #if you inspected them; removed because it's out of character for AJ
 #EQS_advisor.53.d: "You can now issue arrest warrant of Flim and Flam, and conclude the corruption at any time. Of course it would be critical damage to [FF_GetSolLun], conspired with Flim and Flam."
 #EQS_advisor.53.a: "I see."


 inkwell_add_tt: "Raven Inkwell has served as Princess Celestia's personal assistant for a long time, perhaps appointing her could have strengthened the power of §OSolarists§! at the Court?"
 EQS_advisor.6.t: "The Assistant" #inkwell
 EQS_advisor.6.d: "Raven Inkwell, Princess Celestia's personal assistant, was today formally awarded a position within the reorganised government bureaucracy. Inkwell's appointment marks a high note in the ongoing formalisation of the Equestrian administration, with many adhoc roles being transformed into civil service positions.[appoint_inkwell_diarchy] Inkwell's appointment should help to ensure that Equestria's administration continues to be smoothly run in the years ahead."
 appoint_inkwell_diarchy_sl: " While some have wondered if this appointment would lead to increased biases towards Solarist positions within the administration, Inkwell's lack of public commitment to either faction suggests any such impact will likely be minimal. Regardless,"
 EQS_advisor.6.a: "Let us pray for boring years ahead"

 EQS_advisor.15.d: "“Ma’am, are you sure this is the best w-”\n\n“Shush.” Came the reply from Rainbow Dash, pressing a hoof up against her pegasus secretary’s lips as she flew over the gathered formations below. Wonderbolts, Equestrian pilots, maintenance crews, not to mention the accountants with their budgeting sheets and notices. All gathered up and organised in the open for Rainbow Dash to review and understand. While she was helpless at retaining information granted by some boring document, putting it all out like this in front of her? That was something else entirely.\n\nShe came to a sudden stop, nodding to herself and glancing back at the confused assistant.\n\n“Alright, I got it. Lets get this storm a brewing.”"

 EQS_advisor.18.d: "Today, Maud Pie has been appointed as an advisor in High Command. She is from Pie Family's Rock Farm and is the second elder sister of Pinkie Pie, as famous as the Element of Laughter. She also got a Rocktorate in Manehattan. Not only does she merely have that degree, but her knowledge of geology and rocks, her actual intellect, her secret Maud sense, and her physical prowess as an earth pony as well, all of which are known to be extremely high. Fortunately, her desire to protect her family is unwavering, and if we could extend that to Equestria, there should be no question of her loyalty. Her existence will be a great addition to the tactical capabilities of our Royal Guard.[champion_maudpie_diarchy_sl]"

 EQS_advisor.21.d: "\"Oh, Canterlot, What you do on me?\"\n\nRarity was very excited to enter the Canterlot Castle. It had been a long time since she had started to manage the Canterlot Carousel, so Canterlot was no longer a strange place to Rarity, in fact, she could almost feel its stagnation, and she had visited the Castle many times before, but this visit was special. [Root.GetLeader] had appointed her to the position of Advisor for Munitions to the High Command. After a brief ceremony, the excitement had lasted til she was ushered into the office and told what she would be doing. It ended by mountains of requirement form for uniform supply which she was confronted with reminding of those she had encountered during the opening of the Canterlot Carousel.[appoint_rarity_diarchy_sl]"

 EQS_advisor.22.t: "Who Dares, Wins"
 EQS_advisor.22.d: "The Wonderbolt Academy is a boot camp where Equestria's flying ponies are forged into an elite team to defend the skies of our land. Today's expansion in the size and capabilities of this venerable institution has drawn the attention of the public and the excitement of winged foals and filles alike, but it's a change that may not be all that welcome to those who greatly prefer the old tradition to the new things, somewhat more of a metal bird specified as 'airplane' than the more traditional flying performances that ponies have come to expect. But with the Equestrian Army and Royal Guard leading the way in reform, the Air Forces have no choice but to follow suit. And so, with the induction of the new Academy cadets for the new millennium scheduled to take place in the near future, only the stars will tell what the future holds for the Wonderbolt Academy, but hopefully this will be a proper change for the better in Equestria.[appoint_wonderbolts_diarchy]"

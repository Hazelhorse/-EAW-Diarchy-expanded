 cocopommel_add_tt: "Because of her Manehattan origins, Coco Pommel is being seen as pro-lunarist despite her political neutrality. As such, appointing her will strengthen §BLunarist§! side slightly!" #thank to Roserado
 EQS_advisor.4.t: "Arrival from the Megalopolis" #coco
 EQS_advisor.4.d: "Arriving by train from her Manehattan residence, Coco Pommel's heart thundered in her chest as she disembarked at Canterlot Station. She glanced back down against the letter she clutched against her chest; royal seal still attached. An invitation to join the Equestrian government, to work with the civil service and the crown in helping to develop and manage Equestria's industry. She'd never expected to rise this far, always assuming her origins from the seedier parts of Manehattan, not to mention her earth pony nature, would count against her in high society.\n\nShe was pleasantly surprised that Canterlot wasn't anywhere near as bad as she'd feared. Ponies seemed warm and welcoming, and while some did give her odd looks and curious glances as she'd entered the palace, most had been pleasant enough. It wasn't till she'd gotten into the depths of the palace proper, while fidgeting and squirming on her seat in a waiting room, that she noticed the hushed whispers and strained snippets of conversation. Mutterings about her Manehattan background[appoint_cocopommel_diarchy_2]. She frowned for a moment before composing herself, doing her best to keep her nerves under control as she waited for her appointment with the Princesses.[appoint_cocopommel_diarchy]" # I love your horsewords so much !
 appoint_cocopommel_diarchy_2_sl: ", theories about her being another 'Lunarist' being sent into pad out the administration"
 appoint_cocopommel_diarchy_sl: "\n\nCoco would never realise this herself but her appointment had coincided with the arrival of a number of new thestral bureaucrats in the city. Given that Manehattan had been central to Princess Luna's campaign for promoting thestral rights, rumours had started to spread that Coco was the unofficial leader of the new Lunarist faction that had started to develop. While the rumours had no basis in reality, their mere existence seems to have emboldened the Lunarist elements at court, comforting them with the false knowledge of widespread support from the wider population."
 EQS_advisor.4.a: "Regardless, She had proved herself."

 EQS_advisor.400.t: "Coco in Canterlot?" #cocopommel event chain 1
 EQS_advisor.400.d: "As the days passed,  would find herself being increasingly requested to aid in projects from the Lunarist faction of the court. Helping to design new bat pony fashions, military funding, diverting of resources to special projects etc. How will she proceed?"
 EQS_advisor.400.a: "Coco firmly rejects the offers to involve herself in petty court factionalism"
 EQS_advisor.400.b: "Coco politely declines the requests"
 EQS_adv_400b_tt: "She would continue to avoid this situation, so there will be no change in the balance of power."
 EQS_advisor.400.c: "She is more than happy to help them"
 
 flim_flam_add_tt: "The Flim Flam brothers are eager to get involved in Princess Luna's militarisation plans, offering their patented engine designs and factories to aid the nation."
 EQS_advisor.5.t: "Art of Business" #flim_flam
 EQS_advisor.5.d: "Despite their less than stellar reputation, the engineering talents of the Flim Flam brothers are something that Equestria cannot afford to waste. While their desires for ‘Flim Flam bug zapper 9000’ are a tad too unreasonable for our tastes, their business experience and mechanical knowledge will no doubt help our economy in the long run. [appoint_flim_flam_diarchy]"
 appoint_flim_flam_diarchy_sl: "All for the cause." #5% to lunarist
 EQS_advisor.5.a: "I'm sure this won't backfire on us at all, right?"

 EQS_advisor.50.t: "A shady offer" #(being fired 33-36 days after his appointment or by on_actions_EQS_diarchy.txt)
 EQS_advisor.50.d: "The Flim Flam brother’s dishonest nature is well known. Too well known. It seems that several minor officials from the royal court have approached them, trying to gain aid for their political factions in exchange for cash."
 EQS_advisor.50.a: "The brothers refused the offer." #never leads to scandal
 EQS_adv_50a_tt: "Keeping your hooves §Pclean§! is probably the most important thing you can do to stay in public service."
 EQS_advisor.50.b: "The brothers accepted the proposal of the Solarist officials." #bump sol bop
 EQS_advisor.50.c: "The brothers accepted the proposal of the Lunarist officials" #bump lun bop

 EQS_advisor.51.t: "Flim-Flam Suspicion" #135 days after #50
 EQS_advisor.51.d: "The Flim-Flam brothers have been found to be highly corrupt, having taken bribes from officials and nobles in order to influence government policy.[ffscandal][eqsdiarchy_advisor_51]"
 ffscandal_sl_sol: "\n\nIt seems that several prominent Solarist figures have been involved in this ring of corruption, trying to use the brothers access and official position as a way to swing things in their favour, despite the will of the princesses."
 ffscandal_sl_lun: "\n\nIt seems that several prominent Lunarist figures have been involved in this ring of corruption, trying to use the brothers access and official position as a way to swing things in their favour, despite the will of the princesses."
 eqsdiarchy_advisor_51_yes: "\n\nThe Flim-Flam brothers have abused their office!" #if you have them as an advisor
 eqsdiarchy_advisor_51_no: "\n\nWhile they might be out of office, the damage caused still lingers." #if you don't have

 EQS_advisor.51.c: "Denounce the officials that partook in this corruption!" #bumps solar bop
 EQS_flim_flam_fire_tt: "\n§YFlim and Flam§! will §Rno longer be available§! as Political Advisor.\n"

 EQS_advisor.52.t: "Flim-Flam Apprehension" #take that decision
 EQS_advisor.52.d: "Under the leadership of Applejack, the element of Honesty, the crimes of the Flim-Flam brothers have been discovered and the duo tracked down, charged and dealt with. They, along with everyone else involved have been found, fined and sentenced to community service for their misdeeds."
 EQS_advisor.52.a: "Applejack has a bright future ahead of her in our government!" #you can now appoint her.

 #EQS_advisor.53.t: "Every Evidence Has Been Collected" #if you inspected them; removed because it's out of character for AJ
 #EQS_advisor.53.d: "You can now issue arrest warrant of Flim and Flam, and conclude the corruption at any time. Of course it would be critical damage to [FF_GetSolLun], conspired with Flim and Flam."
 #EQS_advisor.53.a: "I see."

 #follow-up event could be the flim-flam trial(if you're willing to write them)

 inkwell_add_tt: "Raven Inkwell has served as Princess Celestia's personal assistant for a long time, perhaps appointing her could have strengthened the power of §OSolarists§!?"
 EQS_advisor.6.t: "The Assistant" #inkwell
 EQS_advisor.6.d: "Raven Inkwell, Princess Celestia's personal assistant, was today formally awarded a position within the reorganised government bureaucracy. Inkwell's appointment marks a high note in the ongoing formalisation of the Equestrian administration, with many adhoc roles being transformed into civil service positions.[appoint_inkwell_diarchy] Inkwell's appointment should help to ensure that Equestria's administration continues to be smoothly run in the years ahead."
 appoint_inkwell_diarchy_sl: " While some have wondered if this appointment would lead to increased biases towards Solarist positions within the administration, Inkwell's lack of public commitment to either faction suggests any such impact will likely be minimal. Regardless,"
 EQS_advisor.6.a: "Let us pray for boring years ahead"

 #fancy_pants
 fancy_pants_add_tt: "As a member of the traditional elite, Fancy Pants supports the §OSolarists§! faction at Court"

Despite this, he remains and invaluable tool for the smooth running of the Equestrian administration.[appoint_fancy_pants_diarchy]"
 appoint_fancy_pants_diarchy_sl: " This will, of course, aid the Solarist faction at court..."
 EQS_advisor.7.a: "More of the same for Equestria"

 EQS_advisor.15.d: "“Ma’am, are you sure this is the best w-”\n\n“Shush.” Came the reply from Rainbow Dash, pressing a hoof up against her pegasus secretary’s lips as she flew over the gathered formations below. Wonderbolts, Equestrian pilots, maintenance crews, not to mention the accountants with their budgeting sheets and notices. All gathered up and organised in the open for Rainbow Dash to review and understand. While she was helpless at retaining information granted by some boring document, putting it all out like this in front of her? That was something else entirely.\n\nShe came to a sudden stop, nodding to herself and glancing back at the confused assistant.\n\n“Alright, I got it. Lets get this storm a brewing.”" #[appoint__diarchy]

 EQS_advisor.21.d: "\"Oh, Canterlot, What you do on me?\"\n\nRarity was very excited to enter the Canterlot Castle. It had been a long time since she had started to manage the Canterlot Carousel, so Canterlot was no longer a strange place to Rarity, in fact, she could almost feel its stagnation, and she had visited the Castle many times before, but this visit was special. [Root.GetLeader] had appointed her to the position of Advisor for Munitions to the High Command. After a brief ceremony, the excitement had lasted til she was ushered into the office and told what she would be doing. It ended by mountains of requirement form for uniform supply which she was confronted with reminding of those she had encountered during the opening of the Canterlot Carousel.[appoint_rarity_diarchy_sl]"

 EQS_advisor.210.d: "$EQS_advisor.21.d$\n\nMeanwhile Rarity was still a prominent supporter of Princess Luna's campaign for promoting thestral rights, despite of the unsavoury incidents that had recently occured.

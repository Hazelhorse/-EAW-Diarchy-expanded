eqs_grow_larger:0 "The Growth of the Realm"
eqs_grow_larger_desc:0 "While Equestria is a mighty nation today, it has not always been so. Over the last ten centuries it slowly absorbed other pony lands to make a unified home for ponykind. Who knows what new lands might come to be part of Equestria in the future."

eqs_STG_revolt_crushed_desc:0 "Despite their treasonous attempts at revolution, the red rebels have once again fallen before the might of Equestria. Let this be a lesson for all unharmonic traitors that would dare stand against the Crown."
eqs_leadership_pit:0 "Remove the Leadership"
eqs_leadership_pit_desc:0 "Celestia, despite her ancient wisdom, was far too lenient last time. There is only one solution to the Red problem, a swift removal of the pests that poison the minds our of ponies with their lies. To Tartarus with them."
eqs_stg_win_them:0 "Lighten the Hoof"
eqs_stg_win_them_desc:0 "The Second Revolt occured because we pushed the ponies of the region too hard. We must win them over and work with them to ensure they will accept us and our rule over them in the future."
eqs_stg_crush_them:0 "Tighten the Grip"
eqs_stg_crush_them_desc:0 "The Second Revolt occured because we showed too much mercy to the traitors, partisans and rebels that infest the region. We need to cleanse them and give them no quarter in order to protect our little ponies."
eqs_stg_reforms:0 "Provide Economic Aid"
eqs_stg_reforms_desc:0 "By providing aid to those ponies who need it, we can slowly win over the public's trust. No pony can be mad with us if they have a full stomach and a safe place to live, after all."
eqs_stg_reforms2:0 "Regulate the Industry"
eqs_stg_reforms2_desc:0 "Unregulated, uncontrolled greed by landowners and industrialists lead to the first two revolts. There will not be a third. Strict measures will be put in place to ensure that the rights and dignity of workers in the fields and factories are respected throughout Equestria."
eqs_stg_reforms3:0 "Allow Limited unions"
eqs_stg_reforms3_desc:0 "While we obviously aren't going to give any major concessions to the Reds, allowing limited, state controlled unions in the factories will provide a way for us to manage and control popular unrest without it spilling out into voilence once again."
eqs_stg_burn:0 "Crush any Rebels"
eqs_stg_burn_desc:0 "There can be no mercy, no respite for those who attack our ponies and seek to spread terror. These threats will be hunted down and exterminated, for the good of Equestria"
eqs_stg_no_gun:0 "Maintain Martial Law"
eqs_stg_no_gun_desc:0 "Martial law shall be retained within the region for the forseeable future. Public gatherings of more than five ponies will be banned, and all gun owners will be required to hand in their weaponary, on threat of imprisonment."
eqs_stg_com_ban:0 "Outlaw Communism"
eqs_stg_com_ban_desc:0 "Marks was a fool. A fool that has inspired our ponies to slaughter each other twice in the same century of time. We cannot allow these destructive ideas to be maintained any longer. Henceforth they will be banned throughout the realm."
eqs_stg_settlement:0 "Encourage Equestrian Settlement"
eqs_stg_settlement_desc:0 "Even before the first revolt, Severnya retained its own unique, special culture, seperate from wider Equestria. This was a mistake. Ponies from throughout the land will be invited to settle and live within the region, in order to show the locals how a true pony acts."
eqs_stg_friendship_school:0 "Severyanian School of Friendship"
eqs_stg_friendship_school_desc:0 "Severyanians are a strange breed, and one that do not seem to know how to properly live with other ponies as friends. By establishing a new school of friendship in the region, we can come to ensure that future generations learn how to properly interact with other ponies."
eqs_stg_apple_industries:0 "Invite Equestrian Landowners"
eqs_stg_apple_industries_desc:0 "Earth pony farming clans are the backbone of the Equestrian economy and the equestrian way of life. By inviting representatives from several of the largest clans and businesses to the region, we can help ensure they put down new roots and branches that will further tie the region to Equestria."
eqs_stg_owned:0 "Reintergration of Severyana"
eqs_stg_owned_desc:0 "After much struggle, blood, sweat and tears, Severyana has finally returned home. It is now and forevermore a part of Equestria and will remain so for as long as the princesses reign!"
eqs_STG:0 "The Red Threat"
eqs_STG_desc:0 "The recent actions undertaken by the our Red neighbour shows that we cannot simply ignore them. We must prepare to defend our ponies."
eqs_stgreinforce_border:0 "The Luna Line"
eqs_stgreinforce_border_desc:0 "By building a line of fortifications along our border with Stalliongrad, we can ensure that any invasion into our land will be easily repulsed."
eqs_stg_River_Fortifications:0 "The Manehattan Bulwark"
eqs_stg_River_Fortifications_desc:0 "While our high command has full confidence in our existing defensive planning, it would be wise to prepare a back up, in case worse comes to worse. A secondary line stretching along the river from Manehattan to the mountains should do it."
eqs_stg_undermine:0 "Increase S.M.I.L.E. Operations"
eqs_stg_undermine_desc:0 "Waging war to avenge ponies being killed would be madness. We cannot order more ponies towards death or disfigurement in some vain attempt to avenge past mistakes. Instead, we must undermine our enemy, and make him our friend."
eqs_stg_friendship:0 "Pact of Friendship"
eqs_stg_friendship_desc:0 "Through our generosity, kindness, laughter, loyalty, honesty, and the magic of complete infiltration of their civilian government, we have managed to convience Stalliongrad that we should enter into a pact of Friendship and non-aggression."
eqs_STG_try_leaders:0 "The Canterlot Trials"
eqs_STG_try_leaders_desc:0 "Having captured the leadership of the Red State, we must now bring them to trial. Hopefully showing them that their government is no more and that their leaders are captive will encourage the rebels to submit and realise their cause is lost."
eqs_stg_remove_cores:0 "Remove their Spies"
eqs_stg_remove_cores_desc:0 "Countless ponies with sympathies for the Red State live, work and operate within the border. In the event of war, this could be a fifth column that would rise up and hand these lands over to the Communists. We must strike first and remove this threat."
eqs_stg_trade:0 "Provide Famine Relief"
eqs_stg_trade_desc:0 "Stalliongrad has suffered from food insecurity ever since their separation from the rest of Equestria. If we provide foreign aid, free of charge, it will do much to improve their view of us. Nopony can stay angry on a full stomach."
eqs_stg_embargo:0 "Throttle their Factories"
eqs_stg_embargo_desc:0 "The Stalliongrad economy is still reeling from failed attempts at industrialisation and collectivisation. If we halt all trade flowing between Equestria and the Reds, we will hopefully be able to cause their economy to crumble under its own weight."
eqs_stg_war:0 "Contain the Threat"
eqs_stg_war_desc:0 "Despite our efforts, the Red Hydra still stands. We cut off one tendril and another seems to sprout. We cannot allow this danger to persist any longer, remember the Baltimare victims. Forwards!"
eqs_STG_conquered:0 "The Failed Revolution"
eqs_STG_conquered_desc:0 "The mistakes of 995 have finally been corrected. With the violent successionists dealt with, the Severyanian will no doubt welcome the change to reunite with the rest of Equestria."
eqs_STG_fix_food:0 "Famine Relief"
eqs_STG_fix_food_desc:0 "While famine in 995 drove the Severyanian into the hooves of the Reds, the situation does not seem to have improved much in the past decade. Whatever system the Reds hoped to fix it with has been ruined by the war, we must start importing food into the region."
eqs_STG_land:0 "The Issue of Land Ownership"
eqs_STG_land_desc:0 "Due to their strange beliefs about land ownership, the majority of farm land in Severyana was held in the hooves of the Red State. With its defeat, legal control and ownership of those lands has now passed to the Equestrian Crown. What are we to do with it?"
eqs_STG_land_privatise:0 "Privitisation of Farmland"
eqs_STG_land_privatise_desc:0 "The only way to restore this land to productivity and growth is to sell it to the brave entrepreneurs and industrialists whose tireless work has ensured Equestria's place as an industrialised super power."
eqs_STG_land_farmers:0 "The Legal Rights of Landlords"
eqs_STG_land_farmers_desc:0 "Unfortunately, the decades of Red rule appear to have brainwashed the common pony into being selfish, greedy creatures that have no respect for property owners. While the state will ensure that landlords are not abusing their tennants, measures must be taken to clamp down on squatting and unlawful occupation."
eqs_STG_industry_privitise:0 "Privitisation of Industry"
eqs_STG_industry_privitise_desc:0 "Across Equestria factory owners generiously provide employment and opportunity to the masses in need of work. Factory owners shoulder the bulk of the risk and dangers of factory management. There is little reason why this system should not be restored within Severyana. "
eqs_STG_land_crown:0 "Crown Estates"
eqs_STG_land_crown_desc:0 "Rather than sell off, or give away the land, the Equestrian Crown can simply keep it and use the funds it generates to support the state. Renting out land to tennants at a reasonable rate, and sheparding them from dangers, will keep ponies safe while turning a tidy profit for us."
eqs_STG_land_crown_mech:0 "Invest in Mechanisation"
eqs_STG_land_crown_mech_desc:0 "The region thrives under the guiding hooves of the Princesses, yet more can be done. By supplying tractors and new farming equipment to our subjects we can ensure they are able to continue to live happy, productive lives in peace and harmony."
eqs_STG_crown_industry:0 "Royal Joint Stock Industries"
eqs_STG_crown_industry_desc:0 "Not every industry needs to be full sold off to private hooves. By ensuring the Crown retains majority shares in the largest of the industrial concerns in the region, we can ensure that the conditions of 995 never happen again. The profit for the state coffers is only an added bonus, of course."
eqs_STG_land_coop:0 "Maintain the Communes"
eqs_STG_land_coop_desc:0 "Traditionally farms in Equestria would be run by large clans of earth ponies, organised together for the common good. The commune system we've found in Severyana seems to just be an evolution of this structure. There's no reason that we can't maintain it moving forwards."
eqs_STG_land_coop_tractor:0 "Support Tractor Stations"
eqs_STG_land_coop_tractor_desc:0 "While our decision to support their communal land ownership has been extremely popular amongst the locals, we can do more. If we were to set up machine tractor depots, and provide lines of credit to villages, we could rapidly mechanise agricultural production in the region. "
eqs_STG_industrial_union:0 "Allow Worker Cooperatives"
eqs_STG_industrial_union_desc:0 "As strange as it seems, the Severyanian model appears to work for them. Instead of a single pony taking the profits, or shouldering the hardships, the wealth and costs of running the factory are split amongst the ponies that work there. While strange, production does not seem to have been slowed by this."
eqs_STG_modernise_industry:0 "Finish the Industrialisation"
eqs_STG_modernise_industry_desc:0 "Severyana's potential was squandered under the communist regimes, but under our guiding hoof we can finally allow it to mature and become the industrial beacon it was always meant to be. Full electrification of the region will increase both productivity, and the standard of living for the local ponies."
eqs_STG_oil:0 "Fuel Experiments"
eqs_STG_oil_desc:0 "Severyana is not naturally blessed with much in the way of oil. The reds seemed to have realised this, and had drawn up several plans for deeper drilling of what little reserves do exist, combined with heavy investment into alternative fuel sources. We should consider looking into these plans."
EQS_to_STG_railway:0 "Canterlot - Princessyn Railway"
EQS_to_STG_railway_desc:0 "With the regions industry now once again up and running, it's about time we improved the transportation links between the regional capital and Canterlot, to ensure swift communication and ease of transport."
STG_to_CRY_railway:0 "Crystal City - Princessyn Railway"
STG_to_CRY_railway_desc:0 "Despite being neighbours, few links exist between Severyana and the Crystal Empire, owing to the latter's banishment by King Sombra for 1,000 years. We should help out our friends by building new networks to connect them to our lands."
eqs_STG_trot:0 "Rebirth of Trottingham"
eqs_STG_trot_desc:0 "With the return of Severyana to Equestria, Trottingham has seen a renewed period of economic growth and plenty. Once again the city acts as a hub of trade for resources traveling to and from the region and Griffonia."
STG_royal_land:0 "A Royal province"
STG_royal_land_desc:0 "Under the wise and motherly hoof of the Princesses, the region has once again become part of Equestria. Shielded from the lies of the Reds and the nobility that would ruin them, our little ponies are prospering under the loving gaze of the sun and moon."
EQS_study_tanks:0 "Study their weapon designs"
EQS_study_tanks_desc:0 "In and amongst archives of the former regime sits a number of interesting proposals for tank designs. While our own armour is, of course, superior, it wouldn't hurt for us to take some inspiration from the Reds where we can. No point reinventing the wheel."
STG_commie_land:0 "Our Loyal Reds"
STG_commie_land_desc:0 "While few believed it was possible, our fair treatment and support of the communes and workers organisations in the region has led to them whole heartedly accepting their future as part of Equestria. While some foreign states deny this as 'communist infiltration', we are simply happy that our little ponies have come home"
eqs_peace:0 "Si Vis Pacem..."
eqs_peace_desc:0 "Equestria is the industrial power house of Equus. If we want our new friends to be able to stand on their own hooves, we need to help them stand as tall as we do. Generosity goes a long way everypony."
eqs_afield:0 "Harmony Beyond Equus"
eqs_afield_desc:0 "We are not so shortsighted, nor selfish, to to stop caring about ponies and other creatures beyond our own front door. As we learned with our Kirin friends, friendship spans across the globe. We must ensure that everycreature has a change to live under friendship and harmony, no matter where they are. "
eqs_war:0 "...Para Bellum"
eqs_war_desc:0 "As the recent years have shown, friendship cannot be spread by good will alone. Equestria must be prepared to fight for its friendships, and to ensure that its allies are able to work with us towards that noble goal."
eqs_paxref:0 "The End Of the Beginning"
eqs_paxref_desc:0 "Equestria has awoken from it's long slumber. Yet what will the future hold for Equestria, and ponykind? Should ponykind spread harmony to all others, or return to slumber now that it is safe? Only a referendum can decide the future of Equestria... "
eqs_pax:0 "Pax Harmoniae"
eqs_pax_desc:0 "The last decade has shown us that Equestria cannot afford to ignore the wider world. Harmony at home can only be protected if we ensure it spreads to our neighbours, lest we be once again threatened and undermined by monsters seeking conquest. We must prepare to defend harmony across Equus from whomever would threaten it! For Friendship!"
eqs_pax_bird:0 "The Griffin Colony"
eqs_pax_bird_desc:0 "Founded in the 8th century ALB, the Griffon colony in Equus has been a dumping ground for political exiles, radicals and the dispossed flowing out of Griffonia. We should check in on them to see how they've developed without the empire lording over them."
eqs_pax_bird_good:0 "The Harmonic Colony"
eqs_pax_bird_good_desc:0 "Thankfully it seems that harmony and friendship has made its way into the hearts of our northern griffin neighbours. Despite political assassinations and strife, they have managed to come to adopt the principles of harmony that we hold so dear."
eqs_pax_bird_evil:0 "Operation - Feathered Fiends"
eqs_pax_bird_evil_desc:0 "Woefully, it seems our feathered neighbours have turned to disharmony and evil, following the assassination of their former ruler. We must stem in to help guide them back onto the path of friendship and joy for all."
eqs_pax_bear_good:0 "Frozen Harmony"
eqs_pax_bear_good_desc:0 "The reign of Queen Eira has seen the polar bears shed many of their more backwards, brutal ways, and led to the creation of a frozen kingdom with a unique system of harmony, not seen elsewhere on Equus. There is much we can learn from them, and their appreciation of nature. Let us shake hoof and paw with our new friends."
eqs_pax_bear_evil:0 "Operation - Northern Joy"
eqs_pax_bear_evil_desc:0 "We know that bears can learn harmony. Eira, the bear chieftess that lived for so many years with us in Equestria showed us as much. While we had hoped that she would be able to bring harmony to the ursines by herself, it seems that progressive forces in the frozen north will need our aid to ensure their liberation."
eqs_pax_north:0 "The Penguin Kingdom"
eqs_pax_north_desc:0 "The Frozen lands of the penguins is a land that Equestria has few contacts with. Despite the lack of official diplomacy, a number of our ponies have moved up into the frozen north to help modernise and develop the region. We should reach out to local elites to ensure our expats are cared for."
eqs_deerpax:0 "The Olenian Issue"
eqs_deerpax_desc:0 "While they were once savage raiders and pillagers, the deer of Olenia have recently become much more civilised. With the spread of the industrial revolution, and investment from Equestrian businesses, their frozen tundra has come to shine in its own way. We should send an embassy to encourage further relations."
eqs_pax_deer_good:0 "Velvet Desires"
eqs_pax_deer_good_desc:0 "Queen Velvet has been returned to the throne, and Olenia prospers in friendship and harmony. We should extend the hoof of formal friendship our to deer friends. Together we will be strong!"
eqs_pax_deer_evil:0 "Operation - Captive Cervidae"
eqs_pax_deer_evil_desc:0 "For too long the deer of Olenia have suffered under the rule of corrupt tyrants. It is our duty to help restore the rightful ruler of this land, and to ensure that harmony, friendship and freedom can be spread to everydeer!"
eqs_pax_bug:0 "The Changedlings"
eqs_pax_bug_desc:0 "The changelings were the biggest threat Equestria had ever faced. A cruel, hungry species of predators that wanted to destroy us. Yet now their swords have become ploughshares, their guns destroyed and harmony has come to spread amongst them. Perhaps now peace will finally come to Equus."
eqs_pax_bear:0 "The Bear Kingdom"
eqs_pax_bear_desc:0 "The Polar Bears are a strange set of creatures, one that Equestria knows little about. Much like ourselves, they too have recently begun to modernise and revolutionise their society to adapt to the changing world. We should send diplomatic envoys to them in order to express our desire for friendship and cooperation."
eqs_yak:0 "The Yak Khans"
eqs_yak_desc:0 "The Yaks are a contentious set of creatures who love to smash and show off their strength. Thankfully, Pinkie Pie proved to us all that they can get along with ponies pretty well. We should send an embassy up north to further improve relations with them."
eqs_pax_yak_evil:0 "Operation - Mountain Freedom"
eqs_pax_yak_evil_desc:0 "Despite our best efforts, Yakyakistan has fallen under the sway of un-harmonic, hostile forces. Unfortunately, we are going to have to strike them before they can come to threaten our ponies in the future. May we be forgiven for what we must do."
eqs_pax_yak_good:0 "Reach out to the Yaks"
eqs_pax_yak_good_desc:0 "Good has triumphed in the homelands of our Yak friends. Now that their civil scuffle over leadership has ended, we should reach out to them and invite them into our alliance. By working together we can ensure a better future for pony and yak alike."
eqs_our_bug:0 "To Change the Changelings"
eqs_our_bug_desc:0 "The war against the changelings was harsh. Many ponies lost their lives, and Equestria was changed forever. But we will not give up harmony, nor will we give in to hatred. The warmonger, Chrysalis, who started the war is no more. The changelings deserve our pity, it is up to us to redeem them."
eqs_friendly_bug:0 "Harmony On Chitin Wings"
eqs_friendly_bug_desc:0 "No one had thought it possible, yet Thorax has proved himself as an effective leader of the changelings. Managing to overcome Chrysalis and dismantle the imperialistic military of the old hives, he has ensured that harmony has come to the changeling people at long last. A true friend of Equestria."
eqs_pax_north_good:0 "The Ice Throne Thaws"
eqs_pax_north_good_desc:0 "Wonderful news! The dictatorship in the north has finally crumbled, with revolutionaries and harmonists establishing a new, friendly, regime amongst the penguin population. We must reach out and shake flipper and hoof with our new found friends to aid them on their new journey. "
eqs_pax_north_evil:0 "Operation - Frozen Progress"
eqs_pax_north_evil_desc:0 "Despite our hopes, it seems that the penguin's progress towards harmony has been waylaid by evil that seeks to enslave the population. We must act, not only to protect our ponies, but to liberate our feathered friends from the evil that has fallen upon them."
eqs_STGPAX:0 "Red Affairs"
eqs_STGPAX_desc:0 "Stalliongrad has been a threat to Equestria ever since it’s inception. A revolutionary mob tearing down law and order for their own gain. But this does not mean that we cannot reason with them. It would be far better if we could ensure peace with words, than having to use the sword."

eqs_MTOfortify:0 "Develop the Supply Line"
eqs_MTOfortify_desc:0 "Moving large amounts of industrial, or military, equipment into the region will be a serious strain upon the local supply chains. By investing in the facilities of our local allies we can help to ease the flow of goods and improve their economies."

eqs_osq:0 "Our Osqatian Friends"
eqs_osq_desc:0 "The Emirate of Osqat, unlike many of its peers, is a horse kingdom that has embraced the Equestrian model of friendship and harmonic rulership. They are a prime candidate for our support and friendship, and we should send a diplomatic mission to their Emir post haste."
eqs_osqports:0 "Expand Our Presence"
eqs_osqports_desc:0 "Now that the horses of Osqat are our allies, we have their permission to start the rapid transfer of troops and equipment into the region. Establishing naval bases will allow us to more easily move equipment across the region, while investment into the local economies will help enrich our new allies."
eqs_osqmil:0 "Train their Forces"
eqs_osqmil_desc:0 "While we have no wish to inflict war or suffering onto our friends, it would be wrong of us to leave them unprepared to face any threats that may arise in the near future. Sending a military mission to modernise their logistics and command structure will help our new friends to protect themselves, should the worst happen."
eqs_osqeconomy:0 "Modernise their Industry"
eqs_osqeconomy_desc:0 "Our existing investment into Osqat is already seeing fruit, but more can be done. By convincing Equestrian business interests to plant roots in Osqat, we can help to improve and expand the industrialisation of the region and raise living standards for our new allies. Prosperity awaits."
eqs_osqoil:0 "Map Out New Oil Fields"
eqs_osqoil_desc:0 "By sending Equestrian mappers and surveyors to the region, our advanced technology can be utilised to discover and develop previously untouched oilfields in the region. This will no doubt greatly please our allies by allowing them to better benefit from the wealth hidden underneath their hooves."
eqs_emr:0 "The Four Emirs"
eqs_emr_desc:0 "The conflict in Saddle Arabia has seen central authority fragment throughout the region. A prime example of this is the League of Four Emirs, headquartered in the city of Yabmanein. Representing the lands of four Emirs declaring neutrality in the nearby conflict, the realm has stagnated over the last few years. Something must be done."
eqs_emrwar:0 "Expel the Emirs"
eqs_emrwar_desc:0 "While the Emirs have kept the region safe from the fires of civil war, their rule has done little to better the lives of the local population. We cannot allow them to grow fat while the local equines continue to suffer under their misrule. Military action may be the only option to remedy this situation."
eqs_emrcoup:0 "Change their Ways"
eqs_emrcoup_desc:0 "The Emirs are open to trade, even if they are unwilling to pass the reforms their land desperately needs.

eqs_emroil2_desc:0 "The industrial equipment utilised in the region for drilling and processing crude oil, not to mention discovering new oil fields, is decades out of date and is seriously hampering production.

eqs_emrfriendship:0 "Aid for Every Creature"

eqs_hmr_desc:0 "The Haymirite Kingdom has, unfortunately, remained rather traditional in their approach to rulership, maintaining a tight grip upon the land. If we hope to bring the wonders of friendship to the population, we must find a way to open the country up to our influence. "

eqs_hmrcoup_desc:0 "Diplomacy, and trade negotiations with the leadership of Haymir can achieve without bloodshed what countless bombs and bullets may fail to do.

eqs_hmrwar_desc:0 "Haymirite autocracy is a nut. And like any nut, the best way to break the shell is with a nutcracker. The Equestrian armed forces can easily be that nutcracker. A lightning assault by paratrooper and marine forces would make short work of their armed forces and allow the liberation of the local population."
eqs_middlerail1:0 "Improve their Transport Links"
eqs_middlerail1_desc:0 "The regional rail network is staggeringly old fashioned. This lack of modern infrastructure has done much to limit the economic growth of the region and is making it far harder for our forces to stay properly supplied. By inviting Equestrian rail companies to improve the local situation we can fix both problems at the same time."
eqs_middlerail2:0 "Invest in Local Ports"
eqs_middlerail2_desc:0 "In order to ensure the swift transport of goods and supplies remains unimpeded, we have generously unveiled a new investment plan for the region. Ports at several key locations will be modernised and expanded, in order to allow for a greater volume of goods to be processed."
eqs_middlerail3:0 "Bring the Railway to Karkadannistan"

eqs_hmroil2:0 "Expanding their Production"
eqs_hmroil2_desc:0 "In contrasts to their neighbours, the Haymir lacks any natural oil deposits. Instead, much of the Kingdom’s wealth stems from it’s mining industry in the south.

eqs_diarchy_central_medical_desc:0 "The Equestrian Welfare State (E.W.S.) is chronically underfunded. No longer can we leave healthcare in the hooves of local government. We must set aside some of our budget to ensure that anypony can get the medical care they need."

eqs_diarchy_eastern_mil:0 "Development of Tractor Factories"
eqs_diarchy_eastern_mil_desc:0 "The recent industrialisation of Equestrian agriculture has seen the demand for mechanised tractors skyrocket.

eqs_diarchy_central_industry_desc:0 "New Industry is one thing, but we cannot ignore the needs of our capital. Canterlot is ancient and sections of it are in dire need of reinforcement and renewal.

eqs_diarchy_eastern_tank:0 "Armoured Ordinance Factories"
eqs_diarchy_eastern_tank_desc:0 "The waking world grows ever more dangerous for our precious ponies. A few bits invested today could be a lifeline tomorrow. We need to ensure that our armoured production is able to make up for any shortfalls or sudden demands that might be placed upon it."
eqs_diarchy_central_infra:0 "Expansion of the Road Network"
eqs_diarchy_central_infra_desc:0 "With the rapid spread of motorised vehicles across Equestria, the need for strong, sturdy, well maintained roads has only grown.

eqs_diarchy_central_civs:0 "Investment In The Arts"
eqs_diarchy_central_civs_desc:0 "Instead of diverting further funds to the military, or industrial production, we can ear-mark some funding for criminally underfunded arts and humanities. Not only will this appease the Canterlot elites, it will culturally enrich the lives of the common pony."
eqs_diarchy_southern_focus:0 "Southern Investments"
eqs_diarchy_southern_focus_desc:0 "Princess Luna has long argued that the South, with its largely ignored thestral populations, deserves further investment to allow it to catch up with the economic development of the rest of Equestria. While someponies have doubted the wisdom of this move, none can argue with its popularity amongst thestrals."
eqs_diarchy_southern_industry:0 "Jungle Workshops"
eqs_diarchy_southern_industry_desc:0 "Even with the efforts made to intergrate the thestral economies, the tribal regions of the South-East are woefully underdeveloped.

eqs_diarchy_southern_farms:0 "Mechanisation of Rural Agriculture"
eqs_diarchy_southern_farms_desc:0 "The farming conditions in South East Equestria hasn't changed much in the last 1,000 years. This has to change. By setting up state run tractor sheds and workshops we can help rapidly reduce the amount of hoof-labour needed to maintain agricultural yields. This will, of course, free up more pony power for military service."
eqs_diarchy_southern_plantations_mech:0 "Mechanise the Plantations"
eqs_diarchy_southern_plantations_mech_desc:0 "With spread of agricultural mechanisation labour that would once require hundreds of ponies now requires only a few dozen.

EQS_pegasus_desc:0 "It is not enough for us to simply study how the ways of war are conducted in other lands, or train in the field.

By establishing new military academies in Baltimare and Manehattan, and expanding those in Cloudsdale and Canterlot, our future is assured."
at-gun:0 "Tank Crackers"
at-gun_desc:0 "The Severyanian revolt showcased how ineffective traditional infantry weapons are against even lightly armoured vehicles.

magi-tank_desc:0 "Equestria has always had a mastery of magic compared to other nations in the world.

The strength of steel combined with magical firepower to defeat any foe."
magi-tank2:0 "Extended Magical Enrollment"

Appeal_to_STG_desc:0 "Stalliongrad has never had a reason to hold any love for Equestria or the Princess, but they must see reason in the current situation. If [CHN.GetLeader] and their monstrous army is allowed free reign over Equestria, they will quickly finish off Stalliongrad as well.

In her youth she was a regular unicorn filly and dreamt of enrolling in Princess Celestia's School for Gifted Unicorns, but then an ursa minor attacked her and broke her horn. Without her magic, her friends soon abandoned her and joined the School for Gifted Unicorns. Bitter and lonely, Fizzlepop left her homeland to Zebrica, where she eventually stumbled into the Storm King. Having tricked his soldiers and impressed him with his combative personality, the Storm King offered her the vacant position of second-in-command. She accepted and in return the Storm King promised to restore her horn once he had gained enough magical power to do so.\n\nWhile Storm King was preparing his ambitious invasion of Equestria, Twilight Sparkle and her friends encouraged Queen Novo of Hippogriffia to attack him. During the following Battle of Ain Trotgourait, Fizzlepop managed to capture Princess Twilight Sparkle. However, when she presented her bounty to Storm King, he still refused to restore her horn, which enraged Tempest. After a brief fight between the two, Twilight intervened and saved Tempest's life, and she in turn joined with her and ultimately defeated the Storm King, turning him to stone with his own magical artifact.\n\nNow she has returned to Equestria and embraced her former name, travelling the land and aiding fellow ponies. Her military experience is great and she is more than happy to aid us."

Chiropterra’s sins were numerous, a black stain on the history of ponykind. Even he himself was not without guilt. He had served the Nightmare’s hoof, done his duty for the Night. The only reason he wasn’t rotting in Tartarus with the rest of the leadership was his record of objections to the harsh measures undertaken by the others, his refusal to issue the orders the others did and his attempts at internal reformism. To even think that the Equestrians would have let him run a new state, to trust Chiropterrans to govern themselves? Madness.\n\nAnd yet the harsh rejection of his plan by Princess Luna stung all the same. Like a lance through his very soul, the very princess that guided the moon itself rejecting him and his people’s chance to redeem themselves. Denouncing them, stating that they could not be trusted to govern themselves, lest they return to the ways of evil and hatred.\n\nHe took another long sip of his drink."

It didn’t make any sense. The tales said that the Equestrians were heartless monsters, cultists of the Sun that would burn any bat they found. Yet they had saved his life, they granted the prisoners rations equal to their own and didn’t even beat them. Even more perplexing were the thestrals in equestrian uniform with odd accents that watched them with curiosity and pity.\n\nBut all that had ended now. Now they were being released, being let go, demobilised. Granted a few months of back pay by the new regime, a few ration packs and then sent back to their homes, to return them to civilian life. He knew that some of his comrades wanted to keep fighting, to flee into the jungles, to take up arms. But what would be the point? Everything he knew was a lie.

Faced between the choice of continued enslavement, or eventually freedom for their grandfoals, many natives came to collaborate with the former regime in hope of better treatment. Yet for every zebra unwillingly forced into service, there was another that converted out of pure faith and belief in the nightmare.

Freed all the slaves, providing them with food, healthcare and even housing them in property formerly owned by the Chiropterran leadership. Yet even then, he had not been truly free. The newcomers, the Equestrians, had needed time to process him and all the others, to understand what had occurred to them. He had been brought to interview after interview, called up to give testimony in court, to pick out his former overlords from line ups and report their crimes. Yet finally, he was free.

Dismantled and torn away, across the ocean, as had every other trace of industry in Firstport. They’d tried to resist, to form a workers militia to stop the leeches from stealing their work, but they’d been no match for the stunning spells of the occupation force. Left unharmed, yet with a shattered ego, he had nothing left. No options remained for him in the city. For anyone.

And now its purpose was once more altered. Gone were the explosives, the stink of cordite and nitroglycerin, the guards and propaganda posters. Now stood strange machinery that turned ores and metals into multicoloured toys, packages and gifts for pastel ponies the world over.

Battles and firefights with deluded terrorists, assassination strikes against mad-warlords.

Despite the sun already starting to set outside, a pair of dark sunglasses adorned his muzzle, reflecting her own gaze back at her. “In fact, you’re going to want to take that to them. It’ll help deal with the bastards in hiding.” He added, nodding down at the table, gesturing to a folder that hadn’t been there a moment ago.\n\n“Understood,” said the agent, collecting the folder with one hoof, yet keeping her eye on him all the same. “You’re good. Real good.”"

Then on Hearth's Warming Eve, after she'd been a good pony all year and when she finally was gonna get what she deserved...\n\nHer parents gave her Waddles, a giant coconut crab. Waddles wasn't cute or fast, and when she tried to play fetch with him he just stared. Or she thought he just stared? She wasn't even sure where his eyes were...or if it was a he.\n\nThere was one thing though that Waddles could do that a dog could not; she'd also gotten a genuine 'crab saddle' with him. It took more than a few weeks to get Waddles to let her try it out, but after a few bribes of spoiled sweets and extra shell scrubs; Honey Dew found herself loving her new best friend.\n\nOther ponies might have dogs or cats, but when it was time to play Guards and Bandits; Honey Dew was always picked first! Everypony in school wanted the mare with the personal monster on her side. Her and Waddles led the Guards to victory everytime! He wasn't a pet for long, but Waddles was her battle buddy and friend!"

Upon breaching the premises our ponies came under heavy fire from entrenched red militants and were forced to withdraw, leading to a seven-hour siege that was only broken when unicorn engineers teleported several small explosives and smoke bombs into the compound in support of a mass assault by Guard forces. \nInjured, blinded by smoke and faced with a bayonet charge, the remaining insurgents promptly surrendered and are now being processed. \n\nThe weaponry discovered in the cache, and more importantly, the documents and intelligence that the insurgents were unable to fully destroy suggests that this armed extremist cell was armed by elements within our Red neighbour, Stalliongrad."

While times had been tough before the war, the devastation it had brought had made trade, never mind deliveries of foodstuff, nigh impossible. And with several fillies to feed, she’d had to get creative to ensure each of them got enough. Soups, stews, wild berries and mushrooms from the local forest. Yet even then it wasn’t enough for all of them. She made sure that her foals got the lion share of what little they had, even if it left her weak. Even if her ribs were starting to show.

The Equestrians were kind and generous, setting up in the village square and starting to hand out rations and supplies. Flour, canned goods, preserved fruits and vegetables, medicine, even the odd box of sweets for foals to enjoy. She’d wanted to be cautious, to be wary of this being some trap, but the empty stomachs of her foals had forced her to accept. She couldn’t let them starve. \n\nHer fears proved baseless. The guardsmares running the aid station had been nothing but pleasant and polite, the food was safe and delicious.

Those wishing to remain working upon it have twenty days to register themselves as a prospective sharecropper. Those that wish to remain living upon it have twenty days to register themselves as a renter.'  \n“They’re making us serfs!” Shouted one mare from amongst the crowd that had gathered. \n“They can’t do this to us!” Yelled another.\nThe crowd grew louder and louder, and soon the notice was torn down.

First the villagers had torn down his proclamations and heckled his heralds. Then the Baron had brought in his thugs, hired muscle from Griffonia. They’d cracked down on anypony showing resistance, intimidating old mares and chasing away petty vandals. The tension rose, air simmering between the two sides, tit for tat assaults and retaliations; vandalism met with curfew, robbery with interrogations, assaults with arrests. Then the Baron issued his newest proclamation, claiming that the villagers owed his family two decades of rent, alongside compensation for the damages suffered by them during the revolution and their exile. \n\nIt was the last straw.\n\nWhen the next aid delivery convoy from the Equestrian Guard arrived the villagers put their plan into action, counting on the presence of the Equestrian Military to keep the Baron’s thugs in line. Banners held high, marching as one, shouting their slogans, the villagers protested the baron’s policies and denounced his rule, screaming his sins into the air. The Baron’s thugs, an outnumbered band of griffons, reacted in the only way they knew how. Weapons drawn, screamed orders to disperse, threats of being fired upon. All the while the royal guardsmares were stuck in the middle, frantically trying to calm down both sides. \n\nA shot rang out. A teenage mare, little more than a filly, fell to the ground, her placard falling into the mud with her. Smoke rose from the barrel of a Griffin’s rifle.\nThe crowd surged forwards, pent up anger and rage unleashed in a single moment. Flooding over and around the halpless guardsmares, forced to hide within their truck lest they be torn to shreds, falling upon the Baron’s thugs with a fury non would expect from simple ponies.\n\nOnce his minions were beaten down, the crowd carried on, dragging the Baron out from his lair. The guardsmares didn’t bother trying to stop them. They simply emptied their cargo and left, shaken by the experience."

The father, an old, withered stallion looked upon his daughter, a vibrant pegasus mare, pleading, before glancing to her new companions that were gathered in the clearing. A sorry sight met his eyes. Little more than bandits draped in torn red banners and the remnants of once proud uniforms, a mix match of weaponry and explosives adorning their flanks.\n\n “Dad, I have to do this. We’ll be safe, okay? We’re just hitting a few supply convoys. You’re heard about how chickenshit the patrols are. We’ll just scare them, take their stuff, then bring it back to the village.

Worse, villagers seemed to be growing increasingly distrustful of their patrols, even with the aid they were bringing to them. They were bringing them aid, securing the neighbourhood and restoring law and order to the region, yet for every hoof-step they took forwards, the locals seemed to take two backwards.\n\n”Bit for your thought, Captain?” Asked her aid as she brought the Rain a freshly brewed coffee.\nShe grunted, taking a sip of it before grimacing. “By the Sun, this is vile.”\n“Yes ma’am, sorry ma’am.”\n“Lets hope these Reds settle down so we can get back to Canterlot before long. Any news from our contacts?”\n”Little, ma’am. We’ve intercepted a few Red sympathisers spreading propaganda. Something about us gunning down innocent children.”\n\n Rain snorted as she shook her head. “The Reds will make up anything.

Current increases are inline with previous economic predictions taken from our Red predecessors in the region, thought this growth rate is not expected to last once the post-war rebuilding efforts end. Current economic models predict that the regions industrial output may lag behind standard Equestrian production rates by 2-5%, owing to the uncompetitive nature of unionised industries. Yet worker satisfaction averages at 23 points up over contemporaries in Bale, Baltimare and Manehattan. Despite the inefficiency in the system, the worker driven model seems to be paying off."

Remnants of the Red Army that had escaped capture continued to assault Equestrian patrols, entire villages refused to cooperation with the new authorities, the entire region was aflame. The food supply, already dangerous under the Reds, had collapsed entirely, and the production lines had crumbled to a halt. Attempting to reintegrate the region into the wider Equestrian economy was going to cost more than the entire war had to begin with. \n\n Twilight groaned, summoning a fresh mug of coffee with a flick of her horn. “Spike, clear my schedule.

A portion of the state-owned land inherited from the communist regime will be returned to former landowners, in exchange for generous donations to the Equestrian treasury, and the rest will be auctioned off to the highest bidder. This option will rapidly alleviate the economic costs of rebuilding the region yet will undoubtably inflame local opinion. \n\nThe second option is much more radical. The land would be granted to the farming villages, family clans, communes and other such groups that work the land. What the Red state had promised would eventually occur would be made into reality overnight. This idea is extremely unpopular amongst the conservative elements of Equestria yet would go a long way to win over the locals to our side. \n\nThe third option is that of continuity. The Crown would take replace the Supreme Soviet as the sole owner of public land within the region and would have direct access to the agricultural surplus produced. In exchange the Crown would take on the burden of providing aid, support and protection to the ponies who work the land."

Finding an unbiased jury was near impossible, ponies either loathed them as traitors or saw them as heroes being unjustly oppressed. In the end, it mattered not. The Crown Prosecution Service found the gathered leadership guilty. \n\nThe Sentence - Banishment to the pits of Tartarus. \n\nYet this was not carried out.

Yet the fates had smiled upon her. The new plan of the Royal Sisters, approved by the Equestrian population, aimed to put Equestria back on the map.

The crisp tundra, the bleached white snow. Yet even from this height she could stop figures moving below, tractors and trucks ploughing from the ice and snow. It all seemed so oddly peaceful from up her, yet she knew she’d be feeling the cold once they landed. Still, she thought to herself, checking her briefcase and reviewing her files, it seemed like it would be a fruitful trip.

Meeting local officials, partaking in local penguin cultural customs – she had aced the dance try outs, but had wisely avoided the ice water swimming- and making friends and contacts amongst the new harmonious state.

Stranger, they bare insigna and identification numbers that match no make or model produced in Equestria, or our allies. The military is at a loss as to where these caches came from, but after testing and checking for traps they have been intergrated into the supply network. "
equestriadiarchy.10.a:0 "Weapon caches in the South-East? Worrying..."
equestriadiarchy.11.t:0 "More caches Discovered!"
equestriadiarchy.11.d:0 "As we have continued to develop and transform the Southern Jungles, several more caches of previously hidden supplies and weapons have been discovered. While this equipment appears older than the previous finds, its existence remains concerning. Local commanders have intensified their jungle patrols in hopes of discovering more of these caches, or better yet, whomever left them here to begin with."
equestriadiarchy.11.a:0 "Who stockpiles guns in the jungle?"
equestriadiarchy.12.t:0 "Everything is normal?"
equestriadiarchy.12.d:0 "Despite our forces heightened alertness levels, no new caches or weapons or equipment have been found in the jungle. Even with the help of tribal elders and warband search parties, no trace can be found of any further equipment, nor whom it may have come from. The trail appears to have gone cold. The South is more stable than it has been in decades, and there doesn't seem to be anything for us to worry about."
equestriadiarchy.12.a:0 "We may never know who did this..."
equestriadiarchy.13.t:0 "The Lunar investigation"
equestriadiarchy.13.d:0 "Despite months of searching, interrogation, investigation and even the involvement of Princess Luna herself, we're no step closer to finding just who, or where, the strange caches of weapons and supplies found in the jungle came from. Left over supplies by local bat ponies has been ruled out, as has activities of Changeling or Stalliongradian agents. It's as if the heavens themselves dropped them down into the jungles."
equestriadiarchy.13.a:0 "Keep searching! Leave no stone unturned."
equestriadiarchy.13.b:0 "Give up the search."
equestriadiarchy.13.t:0 "We found a lead"
equestriadiarchy.13.d:0 "With the continued patronage and aid of Princess Luna, our investigators have finally made a break through. The half sunken wreck of a Tobruck cargo freighter off the coast of Baltimare was discovered, containing several sets of equipment similar to those we had discovered in the jungle, alongside several thestral corpses. Sealed documents found aboard the vessel shows that it appears to have come from Northern Zebrica, north of Maregypt. Little is known about that region, especially after the Storm King plundered his way across the continent. Still, by sending an expedition to trace the vessel's course, we may yet be able to find out who is behind all this."
equestriadiarchy.13.a:0 "Organise an expedition!"
equestriadiarchy.13.b:0 "It isn't worth it."
equestriadiarchy.14.t:0 "The Luna expedition"
equestriadiarchy.14.d:0 "On Princess Luna's orders, the investigators have gathered supplies and aquired a ship to trace the route taken by the mystery freighter. With any luck, they should soon be able to discover what has occured and return with their findings. Finally, we might know who was behind all this strangeness in the South East!"
equestriadiarchy.14.a:0 "Onwards!"

equestriadiarchy.15.d:0 "Several members of the Lunar Guard have expressed their concerns about the safety of the expedition and have requested that they be able to accompany them on their voyage. Upgrading the expedition's defences and firepower will certainly ensure their safety, but can Equestria really afford to spend its ponypower on what many are calling a madmare's errand?"

equestriadiarchy.16.a:0 "We have only ourselves to blame..."
equestriadiarchy.17.t:0 "Discovery of Chiropterra"
equestriadiarchy.17.d:0 "The expedition has returned, with shocking news! When tracing the path of the mystery freighter along the coast they came under repeated assault by sea and air by bands of armed and bloodthirsty thestrals. Only by the valiant struggle of the Lunar Guard were these attacks repulsed, and not without losses. Rigorous interrogation of the captives taken revealed that these mad ponies appear to be some form of Nightmare Cultist, part of an organised state of rebels and traitors plotting to corrupt the princess and revive their foul diety. They have now safely returned to Equestrian habour, leaving the Princesses to deal with this shocking turn of events."

equestriadiarchy.18.t:0 "A New Kind of War"
equestriadiarchy.18.d:0 "Colonel Cloud Windshaper took a deep swig of tea before returning to his map. The whole region around Ursagrad was full of Chiropterran guerillas, yet he couldn't seem to pin them down in any location. Every enemy attack caught his forces completely by surprise. Not even command of the air could help his forces, the bat's own flight abilities allowing them to flee just as fast as his command could pursue. \n\nThe colonel's thoughts were interrupted by the sound of a patrol returning. He opened his tent flap and saw a platoon of Pegasi leading dozens of ponies into camp.\n"Lieutenant!" he cried, approaching the lead mare, "What is the meaning of this?"\nThe lieutenant, a much younger pony, had a crazed look in his eyes. "We lost three of our number to snipers as we passed by their village, so we marched in and took every able bodied bat prisoner. At least one of them's gotta be a guerilla, and the rest are guilty of helping hide 'em."\nColonel Windshaper sighed. "Very well, detain them for now and I'll deal with it later."\n\nAs the colonel moved back towards the tent, he heard screaming near the edge of the camp. Rushing to the scene, he found two soldiers holding back a very old mare.\n"Let me in!" she shrieked, "Give him back! I have to find him!"\n"Calm down ma'am," the colonel said, motioning for the guards to release her. "Who do you need to find?"\n"My son! You took him, give him back!" the mare said, breaking down in tears. "Please, he's my only son! Don't kill him, I beg you!"\n\nThe colonel was speechless. If they were ever going to have a chance at pacifying Chiropterra, they would need to win over the hearts and minds of these ponies. But every step they took to combat the insurgents only alienated the population further. Colonel Windshaper could see this vicious cycle spiraling out of control before his eyes. If something doesn't change soon..."

equestriadiarchy.19.d:0 "Despite some Field Commanders arguing for trials to be held in Chiropterran territory, under their own laws, in order to showcase to the public how legal the crimes of the rebel's leadership had been, heavy pressure from Princess Luna has ensured that the political and military leadership of the Chiropterran state will have their fates decided in Equestria, under Equestrian law. \n\n Treason against the Equestrian state, attempted assassination of Princess Luna, slavery, murder, assault, extrajudicial assassination of dissidents, bribery, crimes against Equestrian life, crimes against non-equestrian life, cultural genocide, forced conversions, etc etc etc. The list continued ever onwards. The trials lasted for weeks, with live broadcasts by radio issued to the wider world. Evidence from Zebras, Equestrian Thestrals and most damning of all, Chiropterra's own archives ensured that there could only be one possible verdict. \n\n Guilty. \n\n Sentenced to banishment into the pits of Tartarus, the punishment preformed personally by Princess Luna. The widespread publicity the leadership's crimes, combined with the efforts of Equestrian Moonspeakers have done much to undermine the efforts of the cultist insurgency that plagues the land."

equestriadiarchy.20.d:0 "Captain Wave Watcher idly drummed her talons against the truck's dashboard as the convoy travelled along the dirt road, deeper into the depths of the jungle. They had been meant to reach their destination an hour ago, yet incompetence, or perhaps, sabotage, from their native guide had caused them to miss several turns they'd needed to take. It was almost as it the country didn't want them t- \n\n "Captain, here." \n The report from the driver snapped him out of his thoughts, Wave grunted an acknowledgment before exiting the truck, gathering up her troops that were dismounting from the rear. Before them lay a village, seemingly deserted, its inhabitants in hiding, no doubt. She didn't like it, it reeked of an ambush. Yet orders were orders. Carefully, the squad swept through the empty plaza of the village, before bringing up the cargo from the rear of the convoy. Medicial supplies, processed foodstuffs, toys for foals and fillies. And of course, informational brouches printed in the native tongue. Wave wasn't sure if this would help pacify the region, but it had to be better than just shooting everypony. She waited in vain, yet no ponies emerged from the village. With a defeated sigh, she ordered her troops back onto the trucks, then turned and departed from the village. \n\n\n As the trucks left, Wave glanced back through the rear view mirror, catching a glimpse of a gaggle of excited bat pony foals starting to play with the toys. Perhaps this plan would work after all.  "

Leather exclaimed, "I never would've passed up an opportunity to meet my long lost Chiropterran kin."\n"Yeah, that's great, but try to move more quietly. These mad-ponies have been launching attacks near constantly on any patrol they can find."\nLeather sighed. "Have you considered that maybe you have so much trouble here because you're marching into their villages armed to the teeth and demanding information?"\n\nThe platoon caught sight of a village, and before he could be told not to, Leather Drums darted right in. The villagers were all in hiding, but when they realized that the stranger was not another brutish trooper they began to emerge.\n"Who are you?" asked a sickly colt.\n"I'm Leather Drums, a Moonspeaker from Ayacachtli."\n"Do you mean New Ayacachtli?"\n"No, old Ayacachtli, back in Equestria."\n\nGasps and quiet murmurs filled the village. "Are you with the Lunarists?" said a young mare.\n"Yes."\n"Why?" she asked, horrified.\n"I promise they're not bad ponies. I'm here because I want to help end the war."\n"If you're not fighting for the Nightmare," shouted an old stallion, "then you're a heretic!"\n\nTo everypony's surprise, Leather smiled.

In the story, the three pony tribes, Unicorns, Pegasi and Earth ponies, live an uneasy existence together until a fearsome blizzard forces them to seek for a new homeland. However, the leaders of the tribes all claim the same land and argue with one another, causing the blizzard to appear again. According to the legend, the cold was caused by magical Windigos that feed on hatred. The tribal leaders are frozen in ice, but their assistants befriend one another and create the Fire of Friendship, a heart-shaped flame that expels the Windigos forever and melts the bodies and hearts of the tribal leaders. The three tribes then agree to share the new land, calling it Equestria. After the pageants, on Hearth's Warming Day, pony families enjoy delicious meals, exchange gifts and raise the flag of Equestria.\n\nAnd now, the new year has come. Everypony on the streets are sharing an optimistic view on the future and wishing all strangers a happy new year, because nobody is actually a stranger in Equestria. The Princesses have given their traditional speech to the public as well, rejuvenating the spirit of Harmony and Unity throughout all of Equestria.

However, the risk of going alone into what probably qualifies as something close to hostile territory has given several senior military officers pause and they have directly petitioned the Crown to instead greenlight a full military 'intervention' to the Buffalo to end the problem once and for all. However, despite the Dotted Line Report, the optics of the Royal Guard engaging in what qualifies as an illegal occupation would give even the most hardened militarist in Equestria pause.\n\nOf course, while a full military occupation and invasion would definitively solve the problem of the Buffalo once and for all, even at the cost of losing the moral high ground, an envoy opens the door to both peaceful coexistence and maybe even the integration of the buffalo into Equestria itself. There's just one problem with an envoy and diplomatic propositions and pressure. The Buffalos could always end up rejecting our advances which would leave us out of options, out of a solution and out of a good image. But ultimately, a solution must be taken.

While they have not been particularly keen on jumping across the border, whatever the rhetoric coming out of the Palace of Soviets says, were it to happen, the Royal Guard, with its less than 10,000 soldiers in the area would find itself swept away by the Red Army which, the report reckons would get as far as Albion and Trotsylvania before moving to threaten Manehattan.\n\nSpeaking of the Royal Guard, the report condemns the large cuts made to the Royal Guard over the recent years, blaming them for the near-defeat at Canterlot, using very unparliamentary language to describe the state of the Guard, recommending an immediate five-fold increase in budget.\n\nLastly, there's the biggest, and grimmest part of the report. The Changelings. Information is of course rare about them, and as such, the report makes it clear it's working off hearsay. But, this is the most damning part of it all. The report states that if a full Changeling invasion was to occur, Equestria would surely fall within two years of such an invasion, unless 'radical and controversial' measures were taken, including overhauling the whole state to mobilize all resources.\n\nIn addition to military matters, the report warns about the lack of innovation and economic development in recent years which has allowed other nations (such as the Changeling Lands) to catch up. It proposes large-scale industrial projects and education reforms to maintain Equestria's position as the most developed country in the world.\n\nDespite the dire warnings made in the report regarding the risk of invasion, only the industrial and scientific parts of the report have been publicly stated to be put into effect. In private, however, Princess Celestia knows something must be done..."

Having moved most of the facilities from the older, historical, if cramped quarters in the core of Canterlot to a more modernized place in the outskirts of Canterlot, the new sprawling campus will be able to more adequately handle the many breakthroughs and inventions that are being pumped out of Equestria's scientific community.

They have certainly found them here in Equestria."

This sets an undesirable precedent that our Empress can no longer tolerate. Today Her Imperial Majesty agreed to a proposal to fund the School for Gifted Unicorns from Imperial Treasury directly in form of annual cash injections. These new funds will be used to refurbish classrooms and other school facilities, as well as better equipment and supplies. This also gives the Crown more power and control over the curriculum of the school. Starting this semester, the school will besides be focusing on magic also teach religious and moral values.

Hyperbole, to be sure, but a damning indictment of the state of education nonetheless before our reforms.

With Queen Chrysalis on a hate-fuelled crusade to dominate and carve up all of Equus, all of ponykind is on the line. We must either hang together, or we will deservedly hang separately. Even if it will cost us, and will pain us to do so, we must go to Stalliongrad and ask them for help in this fight for life or death that we are embroiled in.\n\nHowever, there is a vocal wing in the War Council that advocate not selling out thousands of ponies to live under Stalliongrad when it is very well possible that we can defeat the changelings ourselves. The choice of action has thusly ultimately fallen to the Crown. We can choose to ask, knowing that there will be a price, or we can bet on us being able to defeat the changelings by ourselves."

She was given a heroine's welcome in the city of Vanhoover, the largest Olenian community outside of the Kingdom proper. The city had long been a hotbed for resistance against Johan, both Legitimists favouring the restoration of Queen Velvet and communists favouring a restructuring along the lines of Stalliongrad. Common for both, however, is that she has long been a focal point for resistance against Johan, whatever their creed may be. Of course that is where the similarities end, but that's a matter for another time.\n\nQueen Velvet has settled nicely into Vanhoover, having already begun advocating that Equestria should intervene in Olenia to restore 'rightful rule' to Olenia."

In exchange, however, funding and other securities for the Buffalo will flood into their region. Some of this includes the oil fields and iron mines below the Buffalo region which Equestrian prospectors have been very eager to open up. With the strong guarantees by the Crown, this treaty is sure to give dividends for all."

Wide-ranging changes are taking places in Equestria, with older methods and practices quickly being phased out in favour of the newer, more effective methods of work. The bureaucracy too is changing at a hasty pace, with legions of newly minted clerks delivering an effective and centralized governance from Canterlot. Even then, large amounts of institutional resistance to the reforms and the new systems remain within both the Civil Service as well as amongst private actors.."

Based upon the theories of magical annihilation and the failed megaspells, the magi-nuclear principle would be able to harness all of the raw magical power inherent in the crystals used and unleash it by having it undergo an explosive, nuclear fission. Not all crystals can be used, and even then, massive amounts of raw magical power will need to be packed into any one device. But should we be able to produce such a weapon, it would be one of the most powerful and fearsome weapons ever created."

The factories are reporting ever higher production numbers, the Crown ever higher tax income. Indeed, Equestria is about to finally jump into a new era of governance.

 equestria.19.d:0 "Most excellent news arrived at [Root.capital.GetName] today. It seems Dragon Lord Ember has wisely chosen to cede the Badlands to us. This will be beneficial to our southern territories (and for the mapmakers). Our little ponies will no longer have to live in worry over dragons migrating to and from the Badlands and scorching the land in the process.

Whatever his method of persuasion, he has managed to bring some very convincing arguments to the table.

 equestria.21.d:0 "It seems the dragons felt insulted by our demand to cede Badlands. We have received a message by dragonfire saying that they will never cede Badlands peacefully. Almost immediately after, we received more reports of dragons strafing fields and villages in the Southeast. Of course, we were aware of their often so violent, uncouth and warlike minds, however, we didn't think they would go this far. To risk war over such an issue is simply unreasonable and in fact controversial by traditional morals. Perhaps ponies and dragons are too different after all to coexist peacefully.

If we find ourselves in a situation where we need to fight for our ideals, fight for harmony, we must be ready to meet that challenge. While we may have ponies like Prince Blueblood, or our rising star, Soarin, we must expand.

It helped us to understand those we once called villains and even help them begin their lives anew, like Starlight Glimmer, Princess Luna and Trixie. Yet this world is becoming increasingly more dangerous as the time fades. Our homeland and our ideals are under attack. As regrettable as it may be, we can no longer afford to follow the Magic of Friendship. We must steel ourselves, and harden our hearts and chests as hard as diamond.\n\nFor we must remember what we are fighting for. That we are defending all the innocent or weak who cannot defend themselves, and if we were to lose they would be the ones to suffer the most.

Thestrals shouldn't be shunned, but welcomed as the fourth tribe!" Celestia raised her hoof to object but Luna continued: "I know they don't even want to be 'Equestrian', especially with all the unpleasantness after, well...you know. But... they were my little ponies, and I failed them." Her voice dropped to a whisper "I failed them, Celestia. I need to make it right. Equestria should be a friendly home to everypony."\n\nOf course it would be this, Celestia thought. The bat ponies had hardly been willing to join the Three Tribes after their Princess was banished to the moon, and even after Luna's return they were suspicious.\n\nBut the bat ponies weren't the real problem. It was the Equestrians. A small horse is easy prey at night, and something about the night loving bats seemed to instil fear and mistrust even amongst many.

They looked at her with awe, and spoke passionately of their desire for change, whether motivated by abstract principle or personal experience.\n\nThey believed in themselves, not because they knew it would work out, but because every change must begin with hope.

And uh, don't mind our bat pony friend here, he's just passing through"\n\nShe eyed the bat pony. Luna's favoured, to be valued, not feared. She replied with a smile. "Its dark out, isn't it?"\n\nThe group relaxed. "Well, another one! Welcome friend, to the Disciples of Luna."\n\nEyes shone with the same determination as her own - they understood what needed to be done.\n\nWell, nearly all eyes. Up the back, a nervous pony spoke "Anyway, before I headed off, I just wanted to say - I'm overwhelmed at the recent support you've been providing to the bat pony movement, but I don't understand why the secrecy and all these donations of hunting rifles? Surely the focus should be on the referendum, not getting more guns..." He glanced hopefully at Misty, as if she might speak up in his favour. She said nothing.\n\nInstead, the bat pony gazed levelly in response "If you were a thestral, you'd know why you can't depend on Canterlot for safety."\n\nThe pony crumpled. "I'm sorry... I didn't mean... Anyway, thank you all. I'll get in touch again!" He hurried off.\n\nThe bat pony laughed "Now that the fool is gone, we can start the real work."

She wanted to tremble and collapse, but remembered even if she failed, she would still have a friend.\n\n"My little ponies. For millennia, Equestria has been a land of Friendship.

Why don't the other ponies want to be our friends? Why is Luna helping us?"\n\nDusk Horizons sighed. "Over 1000 years ago, Luna was our Princess. She lived at night as we do and made the night wonderful. She loved us, and we loved her. But we didn't tell her. We complained about the other ponies instead, about how mean they were. They didn't like our night, or our bat wings. And Luna grew lonely and sad. Because we failed her, she transformed into Nightmare Moon for a long time, becoming angry and evil. The ponies got very scared of the night after that and chased us into the mountains, where we have stayed ever since."\n\nNight Blossom's face scrunched up, considering this. "We should help Luna then! I wanna go see the Princess!" She continued to bounce and squeak at the notion, making short, gliding hops. Soon, Dusk thought, she would be able to properly fly at night.\n\nThe door opened, and a sombre looking bat pony entered.

And with wholeness came the memories... the Canterlot military codes... the entranced disciples... the stockpiled weapons and the carefully planted instructions. Oh, she HAD been busy, hadn't she? Nightmare Moon began to laugh but froze as Rarity's body moved. She was alive!\n\nRarity croaked "Luna... this isn't friendship... remember..."\n\nNightmare Moon... Luna... struggled. Yes. Friendship... but... ponies did not want friendship, it had to be forced upon them! Luna struggled, attempting to drive Nightmare Moon out of her mind. But the tenacious mare was powerful, drawing support from the nightmares of thousands of Disciples.\n\nRarity's words from that fateful Canterlot day came to her. "You of all ponies know that the love ponies feel can't be made from commands and force!" The support of the Disciples was not true friendship, and she didn't need a referendum to prove it.\n\nLuna spread her mind across Equestria, calling wordlessly to millions of dreams for support - For her, for the bat ponies, and for friendship.\n\nAnd the ponies of Equestria came. Wielding the dreams, hopes and friendship of millions, the Nightmares of the Disciples fled before her, and Nightmare Moon with them.\n\nBefore a crowd of thousands, Nightmare Moon shrank, her features melting away, collapsing. There Luna stood. Wielding the fading power of dreams that surged through her, she directed a torrent of healing energy across the crowd, before collapsing."

Speaking before tens of thousands of ponies gathered in support of batpony equality, a concealed bomb detonated, severely injuring and killing several members of the audience.\n\nSurviving the blast, Luna held back the dark powers that attempted to overwhelm her. Channeling deep reserves of power, Luna healed the wounded before collapsing.\n\nWith Luna's valiant stand, and near universal outcry at the attack, the Referendum has passed decisively.\n\nBatpony equality is a reality, and Luna stands newly confident as monarch, vowing to realise the dreams of those who believe in her."

"When I first stepped back to allow you to lead those reforms, I was so worried! But... I must admit, you've become quite a leader, and even found a talent for dramatic speeches." She winked conspiratorially. "I, on the other hoof, have always been a terrible actor."\n\nLuna laughed. In 1000 years, Celestia hadn't changed a bit. As befitted the eternal Sun, Luna thought.

He pushed, his wings aching as he pulled in to land at the station entrance.\n\nFlashing his ID to a bewildered security guard, he sprinted for the boiler room. The Princess of the Night needed every advantage she could get.\n\n In front of him stood an emergency trip. With a station this large, it would take hours to properly restart. With luck, power fluctuations would trip other stations too.\n\nFlowing Current took a deep breath. Some would call this treason. But true justice required doing what was right, no matter what others thought.\n\nHe closed his eyes, and whispered a silent prayer "Please, let the Night rule.

 equestria.214.d:0 "During their centuries largely outside outside Equestrian Society, the bat ponies developed their own, parallel society and even economy. Being in many areas unburdened by taxes or Equestrian laws, this economy has established itself in many places across Equestria, allowing them to make sure that any bits they earn remains within bat pony society. Even the wages paid by those thestrals who worked as unregistered labourers in Equestrian industries or farms go into this shadow economy and stay there, and over time entire industries, though small scale, have grown up here. This has become a drain on the Equestrian economy as many of the three tribes have taken to spending their money there instead as well.\n\nMany thestrals take pride in their self-sufficiency, and resent the notion of having to bow to the obligations of the society they never were part of. This sentiment is echoed by several industrialists, who have tied themselves in knots trying argue for the preservation the system without saying outright that they want to be able to get away with not paying proper wages to their workers.\n\nIf the thestrals are to be integrated, this shadow market must be addressed, but the question is how."

 equestria.215.d:0 "Whilst bat ponies have traditionally been Equestrian citizens, they live apart from the citizens of other races in their own communities.\n\nBut many citizens want it to remain this way. They think that bat ponies do not need to be integrated into society and brought out of isolation. Some are afraid of possible side effects such as a disruption of societal Harmony, others fear the rumoured Nightmare Moon cultists among the ranks of the bat ponies, and a few think they have no place among the other three races of Equestria, seeing them as complete outsiders. To them, it's as if Celestia was suggesting griffons to be welcomed as a Fourth Tribe.\n\nThe Canterlot bureaucracy has prepared an initiative to promote the integration. Groups of bat ponies would be invited to tour across Equestria, so the common citizens could see them with their own eyes. EEA syllabi would be rewritten to teach about bat ponies and their history. False rumours about cultists would be dispelled by official media. Pamphlets and posters would be distributed, showing photographs of smiling thestrals with the words "THESE BAT PONIES ARE OUR FRIENDS".\n\nHowever, if taken too far, pushing this pro-bat pony information can easily be considered propaganda or an attempt at forcibly changing ponies' minds about the matter."

The changes would take years, decades even, to be fully felt, but the Equestrian public was now ready to accept bat ponies as the Fourth Tribe, standing ready to protect their new friends from harm.\n\n"It's wonderful, isn't it?"\n\nLuna turned in surprise, to find Celestia regarding her. Luna tried to speak, but instead found herself crying. Celestia had made her dreams real.

Many still have not accepted this change. We made so many compromises..."\n\nCelestia stood silent for a minute before speaking. "This is the burden we bear, Luna. You know the threats that are coming. You know the challenges we must balance. This land has stood for over a millenium, and our caution might be what ensures it will stand millennia more."\n\nLuna closed her eyes, trembling.\n\n"I know these changes are not as fast or as bold as you wish. But we have started something with these new ideas about thestrals. Maybe not this year. Maybe not this generation, even.

These Bears, with a fur that mirrored the night sky could easily cleave a pony in half and even fought successfully against some of the most powerful unicorns Equestria had ever seen. However, the times of mythical power and wild beasts have, almost unnoticeably, come to a close in Equestria. Sword and staff have been replaced by rifle and howitzer and now a single pony can wield power that was unthinkable even a generation ago. But to fuel the fires of industry that make these marvels possible, clever ponies are always searching for new resources to exploit.\n\nThe search for new materials led a particular company to the ancient hiding places of the Ursae, in a region which was always thought off-limits to ponykind. In times past, claiming the ore-rich caverns that served as a home to the mythical bears would have been considered suicidal. Now, a few dozen hunters with high calibre rifles and explosives set out to clear the area. Carefully preparing their mines on an open field, the hunters made sure to leave nothing to chance. A spell was used to mimic the Ursa Minor's call for help, and the Majors, alarmed, rushed towards the sound. To call what ensued a battle would be too generous as the mythical beasts never even saw their attackers, before they were exterminated by the hunters' heavy weaponry.\n\nThe prospect of a new mine being opened was front-page news in the local paper the following day, with only the lamentations of an old editor on the fourth page reminding the readers that the time of magic was gone. The small column weight the comforts and safety of modern life against the adventure and mystery of the past, concluding that much was gained, but some things were also lost forever."

#MAIN SIX STORY EVENTS

equestria.173.d:0 "The small train station in Ponyville rarely had many ponies standing on the platform, but today it was more crowded than ever. Almost a hundred ponies had gathered there, half of them with heavy bags filled with food, tools and other supplies. Those would be necessary, for they were heading on a long journey, from which they may not return. The colourful Friendship Express whistled, signalling that it would soon depart. The mood was solemn and mournful; ponies were embracing each other, bidding farewell and crying.\n\nThey were going to war.\n\nTwilight Sparkle, the Princess of Friendship, was there as well, as were her friends, the Elements of Harmony: Rarity, Fluttershy, Applejack, Rainbow Dash and Pinkie Pie. The last three had saddlebags and were preparing to depart.\n"Well, I guess it's time to say good bye," Rainbow Dash said, breaking the silence. "The train's about to go."\nTwilight sighed deeply. "I've said it before, and I'll say it again. I respect your bravery and your choice to face Chrysalis' army. But I'm worried. This is not like the other threats we've faced. This time, a small band of heroes can't save Equestria. And I want you to remember that. Don't try to be heroes. Stay safe, and don't take unnecessary risks. We all want you to return in one piece."\nRainbow Dash rolled her eyes. "Yes Twilight, you've said that a dozen times. Don't worry, we'll be fine. We'll buck the changelings back across the border and be back home before Hearth's Warming Eve."\n"But she's right, Rainbow," Fluttershy meekly said. "You need to be careful. War is... terrifying and dangerous."\n"I'll make sure Rainbow doesn't get herself killed," Applejack said and grinned. "Dont'cha fear."\n"And I don't even plan on fighting," Pinkie said cheerily. "I will provide moral support! Cakes and parties will make even the most grim soldier happy. And maybe I can convince the changelings that war isn't as fun as partying!"\nTwilight smiled. "Alright. I trust you will be okay. We'll miss you."\nThe train whistled again.\n"Oh, wait!" Rarity exclaimed. "I still have gifts to give!" She levitated clothing and blankets from her bags and gave them to the three departing friends. "I made fabulous uniforms and cozy blankets to keep you warm."\nThey thanked her and put the gifts in their bags. "Well, we really gotta go now," Rainbow said. "Hugs?" Pinkie asked.\nThe six ponies smiled and embraced each other with their wings and forelegs. "We'll be waiting for you," Twilight whispered, and a tear flowed down her cheek."

Now he was back in Ponyville once more, worried about the burden the Great War had placed on the Princess. He entered the Castle of Friendship, whose hallways were empty. He headed to the library and his guess was proven correct: Twilight was there, absorbed in work. She was surrounded by books and notes and was frantically writing.\n"Twilight?" He said, trying to get her attention. "I'm back from the Crystal Empire."\nShe snapped out of it and lifted her gaze from the papers. "Oh, Spike! Glad to see you. You came at a perfect time!" She levitated a scroll from her table into his claws. "Send this to Celestia. It's important."\nSpike lifted a scaly brow. "Uh, sure." He breathed shining green flame which consumed the scroll, making it magically appear in Canterlot. "What was the scroll about?"\n"A report on the research programs I've prepared for the magical experimentation departments in Bales, Stableside and Albion. They need her approval before the research can begin."\n"What are they studying?"\n"Weapons," she said casually and continued to work on her notes. "Crystal armaments, combat mage training, use of magic in industrial production. Anything that can help us win the war."\n"I see." Spike walked closer to Twilight and looked at all the paperwork. "You know, you seem to be doing a good job managing all this. You're not too stressed out."\n"Abyssinian coffee does wonders. But thanks, Spike."\n"You know, maybe you could use your organization skills and leadership for managing the frontline? With your clever head, I'm sure we'd win in a month."\nTwilight's quill stopped moving. She sighed. "I would rather not."\n"Why? Would be more effective than trying to invent some miracle weapon. It's always been thanks to your leadership that we've kicked the butts of all those villains before."\n"I-I don't want to have that responsibility now. It's not just six friends, it's millions of soldiers. A single mistake results in thousands of dead and wounded." She shut her eyes. "I don't want to bear that burden."\n"Twi, you know... one day you won't have a choice. Celestia and Luna won't be princesses forever."\n"I'm not ready yet. Just... not yet. Okay, Spike?"\nSpike sighed. "Alright, fine. Do you need any more help?"\nTwilight smiled. "Yes, actually. I'm happy you're here." She quickly embraced him with her wing before returning back to work."

The soldier saluted her and she walked down the muddy trenches, navigating to the rear of the network. Near the underground barracks were a row of trucks, pony soldiers with clean uniforms jumping out of them. A thestral officer saw Applejack and greeted her. "Greetings, ma'am. We've come to patch up your ranks."\n"Good, sir. They've been gettin' more and more sparse. The changelin' night raids are hard as Tartarus to repel." The bat pony turned to his soldiers. "Atten-tion! Miss Applejack is here." They immediately went rigid, standing in a neat line. Applejack approached them and inspected them. "Youngins, I see. I hope they've gotten at least some trainin'," she mumbled. She stopped in front of a red earth pony stallion, her eyes widening. He was wearing Granny Smith's old helmet. "Big Mac? The heck are you doin' here?" she exclaimed. He remained characteristically silent for a moment. "I came here to make sure you're okay, ma'am." Applejack rolled her eyes. "So who's lookin' after the farm now?"\n"Sugar Belle. Don't worry, ma'am." She snorted. "Alrighty then. But don't expect me to treat you differently just because you're my brother."\n"Nope, ma'am."\nLater that evening, the changelings launched a probing raid against the trenches, which they thought were depleted in defenders. Applejack quickly rallied the reinforcements, Big Macintosh among them, to prevent a breakthrough. There was brutal close-quarters combat and she had to crack the exoskeletons of several changelings with her strong hind legs. Big Mac tried to help, which didn't please her much. "Guard our rear, soldier. It's too dangerous here."\n"Yup. Dangerous for you, too."\n"I'll be fine! Now go, it was an order!" As she was shouting, Big Mac looked behind her and saw a changeling lying in the mud raise her head, her pistol glinting in the crimson light of a setting sun. "What're you lookin' at? Get goin'!" Applejack barked. Big Mac pushed her aside into the trench wall, and there was a loud bang. He collapsed onto the ground.\n"Big Mac!" Applejack screamed, and saw the changeling with her smoking pistol. She let out a roar and leaped on her as she was trying to fly away with her broken wings, and began stomping her to death with her hooves. When the insectoid pony had stopped breathing, she rushed back to his brother who was already being treated by a medic. "I-Is he fine?" she asked.\n"Y-yup," Big Mac weakly responded. "Sorry for savin' your life."\nApplejack embraced him. "No, it's me who should be sayin' sorry."\n"Ma'am, his chest is bleeding. I'd appreciate if you'd leave the hugging for later," the medic said."

equestria.176.d:0 "Rainbow Dash had been away from combat ever since she had lost her left wing. Now she was glad to finally be back in action, commanding an air wing and training new pilots when she had time. One day, when refueling at an air base and chatting with ponies of the local garrison, she learned that Pinkie Pie was stationed nearby. She decided to go for a visit, even if it was technically unauthorized absence. So what, she thought, she was an element of harmony.\nAfter asking various soldiers, she finally found the barracks where Pinkie was stationed. She imagined it was a real party house at this point, where Pinkie cheered up the soldiers after tough fights against the changelings. She was wrong. It seemed like an ordinary barracks, with all the bunk beds arrayed in neat order. For a moment she thought she was at the wrong place, but then she saw a pink pony lying on a bed. She barely recognized her.\n"Pinkie?" she cautiously asked. The mare with a straight mane slowly turned to look at her, then her eyes widened slightly. "Oh, Rainbow Dash. Why are you here?" Rainbow was struck by how dour she sounded. The colours of her coat seemed muted as well. "Uh, I thought I'd come by for a visit, to see how you're doing. We haven't talked in a long time."\n"Oh yes. You lost your wing, didn't you?" Rainbow extended her prosthetic metal wing. "Yep. But this new one is pretty rad, so I don't mind. Hurt like Tartarus at first but I'm getting used to it."\n"That's good."\n"Pinkie, is everything alright? Why aren't you... acting like yourself?" Pinkie breathed in deeply and closed her eyes. "I'm fine."\n"I might've lost my wing, but I still have my eyes and I can see something is wrong. What happened?" Pinkie grimaced. "I guess I should tell you, even though I don't want to. A couple months ago I was holding a party for Maud's Rock Troopers. However, there were changeling infiltrators in the group, and they revealed themselves and started shooting." A concerned frown formed on Rainbow's face. "Oh no. And then what?"\nShe shrugged. "I did what I had to, out of fear and desperation. In the end, the changelings were dead, and the party was thoroughly pooped."\nIt was a typical Pinkie joke, but the delivery was so dry that even Rainbow wasn't amused. "That... sucks. I wish I could've been there to protect you."\n"I don't need that anymore. I fight with Maud on the front. I haven't been in the mood for happy things after the incident."\nRainbow was speechless. "Pinkie, I—"\n"I'm fine, like I said. Don't you worry. War isn't the place for laughter. But after it's over, everything will be fine again."\n"Promise? I wanna to see you smile and hear you laugh. We can do our old pranks, maybe that will make you feel better." A faint smile appeared on Pinkie's lips. "Sure, Dashie.""

equestria.177.d:0 "Clothing design was Rarity's passion, that could not be debated. But after months of designing dull military uniforms with drab colours and directing their production en masse, she was growing tired of it. Occasionally, when she had precious free time, she'd try to design a beautiful dress for her own enjoyment, but oftentimes even that wasn't as satisfying as it had been before the war. So now, when she had a day off, she needed another distraction from the stress of war-time production. She decided to visit her friend Fluttershy, who had recently come to Canterlot, and headed to her apartment near the underground magi-nuclear research facility, her mind full of questions.\n\nAs soon as the door of her home was opened, the stench of animals filled Rarity's nostrils. Fluttershy greeted her warmly, not minding the odour as usual. "Oh, hi Rarity, good to see you! I hope you don't mind that I brought some friends along from Ponyville." A bear was sitting on the living room sofa.\n"Uhm, no, not at all darling! Now, prepare some hot water. I'd like to drink tea and have a pleasant chat. We haven't seen in so long, goodness gracious!"\nA toucan and a ferret prepared two cups of steaming tea. Fluttershy thanked the animals and they replied with cheery sounds.\n"So, Fluttershy, first of all: What in Celestia's name are you doing in a magi-nuclear research facility?"\n"Oh, erm, I know it seems strange, but as the Element of Kindness, I was asked to give ethical oversight to the development of magi-nuclear weapons. I accepted, because I think it's important they're developed, and are then used right."\nRarity raised an eyebrow. "You think it's important that they're developed? Aren't they... extremely potent, from what I've heard?"\n"Oh, yes. That is the point. You see, their intent is to act as a deterrent and a threat. Once we have a working magi-nuclear bomb, Queen Chrysalis will be so scared that she will sue for peace for sure! And then no one else will ever threaten Equestria again."\n"I cannot help but regard that as quite optimistic. Chrysalis seems very determined in her cause. Also, what if someone else develops such a weapon?"\nFluttershy smiled. "The day when two countries can annihilate each other in one second, all of the world, it is to be hoped, will recoil from war and discharge their troops. We will have world peace forever."\nRarity couldn't help but feel uneasy, and that this was going to end poorly. But she did not want to ruin the mood or insult Fluttershy. This seemed important to her. It was best to change the topic. "Well, I hope everything works out. So, who looks after your animal sanctuary?""

The old Friendship Express had been destroyed by a changeling bombing raid, so they returned home on a repurposed cargo train. It wasn't a comfortable ride, but they were still happy because they were finally together again.\nRainbow broke the silence between them. "So, we won. How many changelings did you kill? I got 241, mostly from air combat."\n"The heck? You kept count? Is everything a competition for you?" Applejack asked, appalled. "Anyhow, 242, mostly from close quarters combat, as my scars show."\nRainbow Dash chuckled. "Welp, better luck next time for me, I guess." She turned to Pinkie Pie, who still hadn't said anything. "Yo Pinkie, you alright? Remember what you promised to me. I miss your laugther."\nShe sighed. "Not now, Dashie. But maybe later."\n\nThe train whistled and arrived at Ponyville's station, or what remained of it after wartime bombing. The three mares left the carriage and were embraced by Twilight, Rarity and Fluttershy, who were there to meet them. "I'm so happy to see you!" Twilight said and struggled to hold back tears. "You all made it back home in one piece."\n"Rainbow didn't," Applejack said, grinned and poked her prosthetic metal wing.\n"Oh, you three look so weary and battered, and your clothes are beginning to fall apart!" Rarity exclaimed.\n"Well, you don't win wars by looking fancy," Rainbow said with a grin.\n"What's wrong, Pinkie?" Fluttershy asked with concern in her voice. All five turned to look at her. Pinkie averted eye contact.\n"Nothing. I'm glad to be back home. Even though it may not seem like it."\n"You know, Pinkie," Twilight said, "Ponyville is preparing to hold a party to celebrate the end of the war. But I think they need someone to organize it."\n"Aha."\n"Wouldn't you like to do that, darling?" Rarity asked. "Maybe that would make you feel better."\nPinkie sighed. "Alright, fine. But I think I will need you guys to help. I've gotten a bit rusty. And... well, I'm not the same as I was."\nRainbow wrapped her metal wing around her. "Pinkie, we'll be with you, always. And we will do anything to make you happy again. Of course we'll help you with the party. No need to even ask such silly things."\nHesitantly, Pinkie hugged her back, then embraced her tight and began to cry. The rest joined the hug as well, reassuring Pinkie and reminding her that she was not alone, and that everything was going to be fine."

equestria.181.d:0 "Recently, as pony soldiers on the front prepared to celebrate Hearth's Warming Eve, something strange happened. There have been reports that at one fortified position near the changeling frontline, some ponies climbed over the trench waving a white flag. Changelings honourably did not open fire and allowed the enemy soldiers to get near. The ponies then invited the changelings soldiers to celebrate Hearth's Warming with them in No Creature's Land. Surprisingly, some of the changelings, even a few officers, accepted the offer.\n\nAs the moon rose, the ponies and changelings drank cider and hot chocolate milk, sang carols and even played some hoofball. Soldiers casually chatted with each other, talking of their families and civilian lives, and telling traditional stories. Changelings of course do not celebrate pony holidays, but were very curious and seemed to enjoy it.\n\nAfter reports of the incident spread, the high command on both sides reacted. The Equestrian army used this as a chance to show the value of friendship and that changelings were fighting against their will, using the opportunity to portray Chrysalis and her posse as warmongering tyrants. On the other side, the Queen was outraged by this and forbid any knowledge of it to spread, putting the nation's censorship bureaus to work. She then ordered capital punishment on every single soldier and officer who had taken part in the "treachery". However, some of the changelings managed to desert and escape, being welcomed warmly by Equestrian soldiers. They are now prisoners of war but are treated well."

The last summit held in 1005 had almost been an embarrasing fiasco, so extra precautions were made to ensure everything would go smoothly. This time there would be no giant gemstone statue due to the last summit's incident.\n\nThe summit ended up being almost as large as the last one, with delegates from over fifty cities and towns arriving in the capital. There were three days of conferences, receptions and meetings, with Princesses attending them actively. Representatives spoke openly of issues in their home towns: Mayor Ash Moustache's delegate from Baltimare spoke of issues with integrating the local thestral minority and the rising influence of anarcho-syndicalist CAN-TER, Mayor Goldwin's delegate from Vanhoover said something had to be done about Stalliongradian infiltration of the navy stationed in the city, Mayor Rokenhar's delegate from Las Pegasus spoke of the corruption and greed of local companies while representatives of other south-western cities complained of neglect from the central government. Most ominously, the delegate from Acornage warned of ever-growing Changeling military activity on the border. The Princesses took note of all the issues and promised that they would be taken care of.\n\nThe rest of the summit was spent making trade deals, celebrating the local cultures of Equestria's numerous cities, holding speeches on matters of economy and politics and discussing the events of the world at large. At the end of the event, Princess Celestia held a speech thanking everypony for coming all the way to Canterlot and said that as long as the cities of Equestria worked together in harmony, the country as a whole would have a bright and prosperous future."

equestria.184.d:0 "Princess Twilight Sparkle looked over the reports she had laid out on the desk before her, a look of heavy concern plastered on her face. After Nightmare Moon has risen once again and plunged Equestria into a full civil war, Twilight had volunteered to help in some of the more administrative tasks involving the military. That meant filing through all the reports that the army was sending back to Canterlot, and more than a few of them didn't paint a good picture of what was going on, especially in the high command.\n\nPutting it straight, Luna's fall had torn a hole in the general staff. Prince Blueblood was surprisingly performing much better at his role than Twilight has expected, but it was still clear that he couldn't lead the entire Equestrian Army. They needed somepony to fill the place that the Princess of the Night had left, at least until a more permanent replacement could be found. But who could possibly do that? It was clear the generals didn't know, since all the reports were just blaming Blueblood when he just couldn't do everything at once. Twilight needed to figure it out, and soon.\n\nAnd then it came to her. There was one pony she knew who could help. It had been a long time since they had last seen each other, and frankly Twilight had no idea what she was up to now. But even with all that, Twilight was sure that she would still answer her call, and hopefully agree to help Equestria in its darkest hour. She was the best fit for the pony that they needed.\n\nBut first... Twilight levitated a large book from a drawer and opened it to the newest blank page. It was time to write a letter."

Sunset took a seat across from Twilight, noticing a glass already in front of her. "Tea? Should have known you'd already have it ready for me."\n\nTwilight nodded with a slight smile before taking a sip. "So, how things been going for you?"\n\nShe gave a small laugh. "Fine, I guess. Though we both know you wouldn't send a message calling me here if you didn't need me for something." Sunset put down her teacup and sighed. "Guess I better tell my friends that I'll be gone for a while, since I'm guessing it's related to how Equestria is... in a bit of trouble right now."\n\nTwilight nodded. "You're right, and that's exactly why I'm here. You're the only one I know who could help."\n\n"Alright, just tell me. Do you need me to help Equestria win?"\n\n"Yes. Princess Luna turning into Nightmare Moon has left the Equestrian high command in disarray, and Prince Blueblood can't lead the army by himself. Somepony else needs to help lead, and I know you learned a lot from your long time in the mirror world-"\n\n"Whoa, slow down," Sunset said, putting her hooves out. "I'm honored, Twilight, but are you sure that you want me leading an army? It's not like I've been doing that back with my friends, and it still hasn't even been that long since I stole your Element of Magic-"\n\nThe alicorn reached across the table and held one of Sunset's hooves. "Sunset. I know this is sudden, but I need you. Equestria needs you! Nightmare Moon and her followers are killing ponies as we speak, and the longer this civil war goes on..." Twilight trailed off for a moment. "I don't know how much more Equestria, or Princess Celestia can take."\n\nSilence held in the air for a few moments while the two ponies stared at each other. Then, letting go of Twilight, Sunset got off her chair and stood up. "Alright, Twilight," she said, a familiar gleam in her eyes. "I'm in. Just tell me what you need me to do.""

Much like the other patrons there, they talked while slowly enjoying their drinks, most ponies not even noticing them. The few that did, however, couldn't help but stare or at least occasionally glance at the pair enjoying their day.\n\nAfter all, it wasn't often that a pony got to see a Princess of Equestria and one of the highest ranking officers of the Equestrian Army.\n\n"I'm so glad we could both find time out of our schedule to meet here," Twilight said to Sunset, who nodded wordlessly. "I wanted to see you more often after we met in the castle, but with the war I was just too busy to even get a chance!"\n\n"Same," Sunset agreed, putting down her coffee. "Nightmare Moon and her forces never took breaks, and neither could we. Prince Blueblood and I had contests on who could pull longer all-nighters." She leaned in conspiratorially. "I think he might be jealous on how I won all the time."\n\nThey both shared a laugh. "Sunset, you know you don't have to keep doing this if you don't want to, right?" Twilight suddenly asked, her face more serious. "I know I put a lot on you, asking you to fill Luna's old role, but now that we've defeated Nightmare Moon you can always go back to your old friends. I mean, I don't want you to feel like you have to do this for me or anything-"\n\n"Twilight." The Princess paused to look at her friend, who was staring at her. "Don't worry about it. Telling the truth, I was getting a little bored back there. I've already sent them a note letting them know I'll be staying here for a while longer, and they're doing fine without me." Suddenly, Sunset smirked. "Besides, it's nice knowing I've probably saved Equestria more times than you have by now."\n\nTwilight reached over to punch Sunset's shoulder before the two laughed again. "Well, as long as you want to stay here," Twilight said, her spirit much lighter again.\n\nSunset nodded, right before she got a devious look, one that Twilight was almost afraid of. "Hey, since you said I'm taking Luna's place, do you think I'll get to become an alicorn too?" Sunset asked in a clearly teasing tone. "I know I don't exactly have the most moon-related cutie mark, but I think I could do a pretty good job with this whole "protecting ponies' dreams" thing."\n\nNow it was Twilight's turn to smirk, barely keeping a full smile off her face."

equestria.188.d:0 ""Princess, somepony is requesting an audience with you. She says she knows you."\n\nCelestia broke out of the distracted trance she was in, turning her attention back to the present. The war was not going well for Equestria, or for her ponies. The enemy was being relentless in their assaults, overrunning any defense Equestria could muster. Luna and Blueblood were doing their best, but it still wasn't enough to stop the advance. And all Celestia could do was watch from Canterlot, and lead her ponies from her throne while they fought and died for her and Equestria on the front lines...\n\nBut that wasn't what she needed to focus on at the moment. "Let her in," Celestia said, wondering who it could be. She knew many ponies in Canterlot, but the guards knew most of their names. So who was left that they would not know but she would?\n\nThat answer soon came when the doors across the room opened, and a yellow unicorn mare entered. Celestia's breath still caught in her throat for a moment when she recognized who it was, despite having seen her before not too long ago; her former student.\n\n"Princess Celestia, I know it must be a bit of a surprise to see me here," Sunset Shimmer said as she walked forward, determined but still respectful. "But I found out what's happened. How Equestria is in danger, and not just from some magical creature this time."\n\nCelestia remained silent as Sunset continued. "When Twilight first chased after me into the other world, I didn't come back with her because I was too scared to face you. I had hated you for so long, I didn't know what else to do. And I knew I should have come back to apologize then, to ask for your forgiveness, but I couldn't bring myself to come back to Canterlot." Sunset took a deep breath. "So I stayed instead. I made new friends, went on new adventures, learned new lessons I never would have if I hadn't jumped through the portal all those years ago. Even after I came back, I had hoped that I could find a new life there and be a hero just like Twilight."\n\nSuddenly, her voice became much clearer and steady. "Now though, I realize that it isn't there that I'm needed anymore, but here. Equestria is in trouble, and everypony needs to do their part. So that's why I'm here, to ask for you to allow me to help in any way I can."\n\nCelestia did not say anything. Instead, she got up from her throne and walked down towards Sunset, never breaking eye contact. With every step the unicorn's confidence faltered, but she remained resolute when the Princess finally reached her. Sunset blinked as Celestia laid a hoof on her, before she pulled her former student into an embrace.\n\n"Thank you, Sunset Shimmer," she said. And almost immediately, the unicorn returned the hug in kind."

EQS_sunset_shimmer_desc:0 "Sunset Shimmer was born on March 23rd, 974, in the city of Tall Tale. Having a natural talent at magic even before she gained her cutie mark, she was sent to Celestia's School for Gifted Unicorns by her family, where her unique skills and ambition caught the eye of the Princess herself, who took her on as a student. But although Sunset was proud to be her one and only protege, both her hubris and aspirations knew no limits, and she soon became discontent with the little progress she made in her studies. After an incident involving a magical mirror, Celestia was forced to expel her, though she escaped into an alternate world using the mirror as a portal.\n\nYears later, soon after the coronation of Princess Twilight Sparkle, Sunset Shimmer returned to steal the Element of Magic during her visit to the Crystal Empire. Fleeing back into the portal with the Element, Twilight was forced to chase after her, with Spike as her only company. Nopony quite knows what happened while they were gone, but Twilight eventually emerged with her crown secured, and stated that Sunset was in good hands.\n\nFor many years, she went unnoticed and unremembered by many. Princess Twilight only knows of three visits from the mirror world, and none of them for very long. But that all changed when Equestria came under attack, and Harmony itself was threatened. Now, knowing she has to do her part for Equestria, and having an official role in the Equestrian Armed Forces, Sunset Shimmer leads armies into battle with the same confidence she always has in life; defending her friends and her homeland from anyone who would see it fall."

EQS_cynosura_desc:0 "A member of Equestria's naval high command, Cynosura stands firm in her beliefs that a powerful navy is essential in securing a future of Equestrian success. Born from a middle class family in Manehattan, she spent much of her foalhood gazing at the busy harbours of her city; the youthful stories of New Mareland's founding and age-old tales of trades and journeys in the distant lands of Griffonia amazed Cynosura, from which she learned that both riches and dangers lie in the vast ocean and beyond. Inspired to venture through the seas in this new age, Cynosura sought to look beyond the horizon; her parents were inclusive about her career, and had her enrolled to the naval academy she wished for.\n\nCynosura joined the navy once she graduated, and soon her talents began to show. She was capable of navigating large fleets with exceptional efficiency during war games, likewise knowing how to deliver heavier strikes while taking less damage during simulations. Combining her passion with profession, she rose through the ranks, attaining the rank of Admiral, a position only few were able to achieve at her age. She never gave up on her belief, and insisted that a fleet in being was essential even at times of peace. However with only pirates as targets, a navy was hardly Equestria's concern. Only recently, with the storm of war rapidly approaching her horizon, Cynosura might perhaps finally see the opportunity to put her talents and creed at work."

There she found peace, raising her adopted filly and tinkering in her workshop. But now war has come to Equestria and she must leave the lab behind, to do her duty and protect her home."

LEADER_OLI_DESC:0 "Like many of the thestrals who were shunned and forgotten, Oli Equites lived with his fellow bat ponies in the caves, ignored by all. It was not the ideal kind of life, lacking comforts and acceptance, but as long as they had each other, the thestrals were content. This isolation was broken when Princess Luna led her campaign to bring the issue to the forefront of the Equestrian public. Her words captured Oli's thoughts and he went off, despite his parents' protests, into the world beyond the cave.\nHis first and foremost desire was to protect the harmony Luna preached, especially after the incident occurred. Although nopony was hurt, and the event may have actually contributed to achieving rights for thestrals, Oli wanted to ensure that such would never occur again, and he made his way to the nearest recruitment centre. After proving his worth through an arduous training regimen, Oli became one of the first non-commissioned bat pony officers in the Equestrian army, proudly serving for the diarchy."
